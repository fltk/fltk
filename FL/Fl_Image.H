/**
  Base class for image caching, scaling and drawing.

  Fl_Image is the base class used for caching, scaling and drawing all kinds of
  images in FLTK. This class keeps track of common image data such as the pixels,
  colormap, width, height, and depth. Virtual methods are used to provide
  type-specific image handling.

  Each image possesses two (width, height) pairs:
   -# The width and height of the raw image data are returned by data_w() and
      data_h(). These values are set when the image is created and remain unchanged.
   -# The width and height of the area filled by the image when it gets drawn are
      returned by w() and h(). These values are equal to data_w() and data_h() when
      the image is created and can be changed by the scale() member function.

  Since the Fl_Image class does not support image drawing by itself, calling the
  Fl_Image::draw() method results in a box with an X in it being drawn instead.

    Example:

    Fl_RGB_Image has exactly one pointer which points at the R, G, B [, A]
    data array of the image. The total size of this array depends on
    several attributes like data_w(), data_h(), d() and ld() and is basically

    see description of ld(). Since FLTK 1.4.0 w() and h() are no longer
    significant for the image data size if scale() has been called on the
    image to set a different display size.

    Other image types have different numbers and types of data pointers
    which are implementation details and not documented here.

    This virtual method is for almost all image classes the same as calling

    However, for subclass Fl_Shared_Image and its subclasses this virtual

    This virtual method makes it possible to \p destroy all image types in
    the same way by calling
    \code
      image->release();
    \endcode

    Reasoning: If you have an 'Fl_Image *' base class pointer and don't know
    if the object is one of the class Fl_Shared_Image or any other subclass
    of Fl_Image (for instance Fl_RGB_Image) then you can't just use operator
    delete since this is not appropriate for Fl_Shared_Image objects.

    The virtual method release() handles this properly.

    Creates a copy of the image in the same size.

    The new image should be released when you are done with it.

    This does exactly the same as 'Fl_Image::copy(int W, int H) const' where
    \p W and \p H are the width and height of the source image, respectively.
    This applies also to all subclasses of Fl_Image in the FLTK library.

    The following two copy() calls are equivalent:
    \code
      Fl_Image *img1 = new Fl_Image(...);
      // ...
      Fl_Image *img2 = img1->copy();
      Fl_Image *img3 = img1->copy(img1->w(), img1->h())

    For details see 'Fl_Image::copy(int w, int h) const'.
    \see Fl_Image::release()

    \note Since FLTK 1.4.0 this method is 'const'. If you derive your own class
      from Fl_Image or any subclass your overridden methods of 'Fl_Image::copy() const'
      and 'Fl_Image::copy(int, int) const' \b must also be 'const' for inheritage
      to work properly. This is different than in FLTK 1.3.x and earlier where these
