/** Fl_Widget is the base class for all widgets in FLTK.

    You can't create one of these because the constructor is not public.
    However you can subclass it.

    All "property" accessing methods, such as color(), parent(), or argument()
    are implemented as trivial inline functions and thus are as fast and small
    as accessing fields in a structure. Unless otherwise noted, the property
    setting methods such as color(n) or label(s) are also trivial inline
    functions, even if they change the widget's appearance. It is up to the
    user code to call redraw() after these.

     \li FL_WHEN_RELEASE: The callback will be done when this widget loses
         the focus, including when the window is unmapped. This is a useful

         anything visible (like pop up an error message).
         You might do better setting this to zero, and scanning all the

     \li FL_WHEN_ENTER_KEY: If the user types the Enter key, the entire
         text is selected, and the callback is done if the text has changed.
         Normally the Enter key will navigate to the next field (or insert
         a newline for a Fl_Multiline_Input) - this changes the behavior.
     \li FL_WHEN_ENTER_KEY|FL_WHEN_NOT_CHANGED: The Enter key will do the
         callback even if the text has not changed. Useful for command fields.
     \li \ref FL_WHEN_CLOSED : If the user requests that the widget is closed,
         the callback is called with \ref FL_REASON_CLOSED. The \ref Fl_Tabs
         widget checks this flag on its children to determine whether to display
