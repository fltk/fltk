# README - Fast Light Tool Kit (FLTK) Version 1.4.0

## VERY IMPORTANT TECHNICAL NOTICE

** This FLTK repository is still a mirror of our Subversion repository. **

  Technically this means:

  * we may replace it with another one if this appears to be necessary
  * we don't accept pull requests (yet) for this repository


### Technical background

  Our main source code repository is currently (as of Sep 18, 2018) our
  subversion repository at http://www.fltk.org/software.php#SVN .

  We are in the transition to convert the subversion repository to Git.
  Until this is done we have established Git mirrors of our Subversion
  repository at these two sites:

  * https://github.com/fltk/fltk
  * https://gitlab.com/fltk/fltk

  You may use these Git repositories for testing purposes, but please
  don't rely on their structure (branches) and particularly not on the
  commit (and file/blob) hashes (SHA1's).

  Committing to these Git repositories is not possible since they are
  mirrors of the original Subversion repository.

  This will hopefully be changed soon...


## WHAT IS FLTK?

    The Fast Light Tool Kit ("FLTK", pronounced "fulltick") is a
    a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX(r)/Linux(r) (X11),
    Microsoft(r) Windows(r), and MacOS(r) X. FLTK provides
    modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D
    graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation. It
    was originally developed by Mr. Bill Spitzak and is
    currently maintained by a small group of developers across
    the world with a central repository in the US.
