# README - Fast Light Tool Kit (FLTK) Version 1.4.0

## WHAT IS FLTK?

    The Fast Light Tool Kit is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for
    UNIX®/Linux® (X11 or Wayland), Microsoft® Windows®, and macOS®.
    FLTK provides modern GUI functionality without bloat and
    supports 3D graphics via OpenGL® and its built-in GLUT
    emulation. It was originally developed by Mr. Bill Spitzak
    and is currently maintained by a small group of developers
    across the world with a central repository on GitHub.
