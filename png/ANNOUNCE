Changes since the last public release (1.2.34):

version 1.2.35 [February 14, 2009]

  Zero out all arrays of pointers after png_malloc(). (Tavis Ormandy)
  Use png_memset() instead of a loop to intialize pointers.  We realize
    this will not work on platforms where the NULL pointer is not all zeroes.
