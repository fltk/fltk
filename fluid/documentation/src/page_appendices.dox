 \section appendix_app_settings Fluid Application Settings

 ## Options ##

 __Select scheme__ : select a scheme for Fluid. Changes in the scheme will be
 visible instantly in all windows.

 __Show tooltips__ : if checked, show tooltips for most UI elements in Fluid dialogs.

 __Show completions dialogs__ : if checked, Fluid will pop up a dialog box
 after generating code, header, and strings files.

 __Open previous file on startup__ : when launching Fluid in its interactive
 mode, it will load the file that was last open when Fluid was closed.

 __Remember window positions__ : reopen windows and dialogs where they were
 left when Fluid was last closed.

 __Show comments in browser__ : if a comment has been specified for a type, show
 the initial line of the comment within the widget tree browser.

 ## External Editor ##

 When you configure the External Editor text field with a shell command and
 select the "Use for Code Nodes" option, FLUID will launch an external editor
 for editing the C++ code within a Code Node. After making changes and saving
 the code in the external editor, it will automatically be transferred back
 into the Code Node. The shell command is constructed by combining the text
 field's content with the path and name of a temporary file containing the
 code snippet. The file name ends in `.cxx`.

 ## Overlays ##

 __Show positioning guides__ :

 When enabled, FLUID will use the existing Layout settings to propose widget
 positions and dimensions that align with other widgets within the project.
 It displays red indicator guides on the scene to illustrate the widget's
 relationship with its neighboring elements. If you drag the widgets with the
 mouse, they will automatically align with these preferred positions.

 __Show restricted areas__ :

 When selected, FLUID will display a hash pattern when widgets overlap with
 other widgets within the same group or extend beyond the boundaries of their
 parent group. Widgets that are invisible will not trigger this effect.

 __Ghosting low contrast groups__ :

 Occasionally, newly created groups can be inconspicuous during the editing
 process when their background matches that of the parent and no visible
 box is drawn. However, if you enable the "Show Low Contrast Groups Ghosted"
 option, groups that lack a box type or have a flat box type with the same
 color as the parent will be displayed with a faint outline
 in the editing window.

 During live resizing and after project compilation, all groups will be
 rendered as originally designed, without the ghosted outline.
