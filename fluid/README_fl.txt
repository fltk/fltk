Fluid .fl file format version 1.4
=================================

This text explains the history of the Fluid .fl format and faithfully describes
all elements of the format and its caveats.


History
-------

Fluid, the Fast Light User Interface Designer was started in the 1990's loosely
based on 'fdesign', a GUI designer that came with the 'Forms Library', later
'XForms Library'. Fluid's .fl file format was originally compatible with the
fdesign '.fd' format, but evolved somewhat ad hoc to become what it is today.


Basics
======

Fluid is a visual editor, storing the user interface description in .fl files
with the ability to create ready-to-compile C++ code. Fluid can also be used
as a command line tool to translate .fl files directly into source code. It
can be integrated into build scripts and most IDEs as an external tool.

.fl files describe a hierarchical graphical user interface for the 'fltk'
library as a tree structure. Elements in the tree can be fltk Widgets as well
as functional components like classes, C++ functions, variables, etc. .
Fluid calls all elements in the hierarchy 'Type'.


Line Endings
------------

Although Fluid writes all line endings as '\n', readers should tolerate '\r\n'
MSWindows line endings as well. Except for the header, the Fluid reader does not
differentiate between a line ending and a space character outside of a 'word'.


Unicode
-------

Fluid does not handle UTF8 characters in in any special manner (unescaped),
but stores and reads them verbatim, making UTF8 character sequences perfectly
legal in .fl files. Fluid can translate UTF8 into escape sequence when writing
source code file.


File Structure
--------------

.fl files start with a 'Header', followed by a list of 'Options', followed
by a hierarchy of 'Type' entires, the 'Tree'. All elements besides the header
are composed of 'Words', 'Strings', and 'Groups'.


Words
-----

Words can be any sequence of ASCII and UTF8 characters. Words are
always case-sensitive.

Simple words that are composed of 'a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', '0'-'9', and '_' only are
writen verbatim, followed by a space or newline.

All other character sequences are bracketed between between ‘{‘ and ‘}’ without
padding spaces. For example, "" is written as ‘{}’, and ".hello" is written as
`{.hello}`.

The special characters ‘\’ and ‘#’ are escaped by prepending the ‘\’ character,
so "#define" is written as '{\#define}`.

The characters ‘{‘ and ‘}’ are also escaped with a '\' unless every opening
‘{‘ in the word is matched with a closing ‘}’.

Note: line endings are copied verbatim and become significant within a Word.


Strings
-------

Strings are generated with 'printf' statements in the hopes that the
generated text can be read back as one word, followed by a corresponding
'scanf' to retrieve the original values.

Note: As there are no defined start and end markers to a string, a reader must
      know when these strings appear and be prepared to read them correctly,
      even if the String itself is not useful to the reader.

Note: All Strings that are generated by the current Fluid source code
      can be read back as a single word.


Groups
------

To create a hierarchy, Types can be grouped within types. A group starts with
a lone '{' and ends with a lone '}'.

Note: To know whether a '{' character starts a Word or a Group, the reader must
      know its position within the Type sequence (see 'Types' below).


Elements
========


Header
------

The header for any .fl file is

  # data file for the Fltk User Interface Designer (fluid)

followed by a newline, followed by

  version <float v>

wehere 'v' is the version number as in FL_VERSION (major*1.0 + minor * 0.01
+ patch * 0.0001). So for fltk 1.3.4, 'v' would be 1.0304

Note: the version number corresponds not so much to the version of Fluid, but
      to the version of the underlying fltk library. So unless the version of
      fltk is finalised, the file format in the github master branch can still
      change unexpectedly.

Note: if the version number is above the internal version number, Fluid will
      report an error and continue reading, hoping for the best.
      There are no other uses inside the Fluid reader except for fltk2 features
      which is beyond the scope of this document.

Note: fdesign files (.fd) start with the text "Magic:". Fluid can read these
      files, but Forms/XForms files are beyond the scope of this document.


Options
-------

Options are usually comprised of a Word, two Words, or a Word and a String. If
an option is missing, a default value is assumed.

  "Magic:" : used by fdesign, not written by Fluid

  "define_in_struct" : no longer used

  "do_not_include_H_from_C" : don’t generate #include “myDesign.h”

  "use_FL_COMMAND" : use macOS CMD key instead of Ctrl

  "utf8_in_src" : allow utf8 when writing source code, otherwise
      escape utf8 sequences in source code

  "avoid_early_includes" : generate the #include “myDesign.h” statement late

  "i18n_type" <word> : integer 0=default=none, 1=gettext, 2=catgets

  "i18n_function" <word> : function name, e.g. “gettext”

  "i18n_static_function" <word> : function name, e.g. “gettext_noop”

  "i18n_file" <word> : file name

  "i18n_set" <word> : string

  "i18n_include" <word> : file name, e.g. “<libintl.h>”

  "i18n_conditional" <word> : string

  "header_name" <word> : can be the full filename, or just the
      extension e.g. “.h” in which case Fluid will use the same filename
      as the .fl file.

  "code_name" <word> : can be the full filename, or just the
      extension e.g. “.cxx”

  "snap" <word> : ignored

  "gridx" <word> : ignored

  "gridy" <word> : ignored

  "win_shell_cmd" <word> : string, this is the recommended command when calling
      the shell on an MSWindows machine. Implementation may be problematic.

  "win_shell_flags" <word> : integer, interpreted as a bit field: bit 0 is set
      if the .fl must be save before runing the shell command, bit 1 is set for
      saving the source code, bit 2 is set for saving text strings.

  "linux_shell_cmd" <word> : as above for Linux

  "linux_shell_flags" <word> :  : as above for Linux

  "mac_shell_cmd" <word> : as above for macOS

  "mac_shell_flags" <word> : as above for macOS

Note: There is no keyword that marks the end of the options section. The
      Tree section starts when a word is not in the options list. If the word
      is not a vaild type, Fluid will give an error message and try to continue
      to read the file. Using new option keywords makes .fl files incompatible
      to earlier versions of Fluid. Due to the forgiving interpreter, files may
      still be read correctly despite error messages.


Tree
====

If a keyword is read that is not in the option list, we start reading types.
Types represent all possible entries in the hierarchy including C functions,
class definitions, and of course all widgets. A type is any of the supported
widgets classes, or one of the following:

Function, code, codeblock, decl, data, declblock, comment, class, widget_class

Every Type keyword is followed by a word, which is usually interpreted as the
C++ name of the Type, followed by an opening `{`, a list of properties, and
a closing ‘}’. If the type has children, they are stored in a Group between
another opening ‘{‘, followed by a list of types, followed by a closing ‘}’.

  Fl_Group MyGroup {                    type name start_of_options
    label Surprise ...                    option parameter
  } {                                   end_of_options start_of_children
    Fl_Button {} {                        type name start_of_options
      label {Don't panic...!}               option parameter
      hide                                  option
    }                                     end_of_options
  }                                     end_of_children

The file ends when there are no more types.

Note: the "class" type has an additional Word following immediately after
      the keyword. It contains the prefix for the class. A class definition may
      be written as:

        class FL_EXPORT MyClass { ...properties... } { ...children... }

      or without a prefix as

        class {} MyOtherClass { ...properties... } { ...children... }


Types
-----

Type names are based on fltk class names. Types derive properties from super
types loosely similar to fltk.

Note: the hierarchical dependency is implemented twice and somewhat conflicting
      in Fluid via the Fl_..._Type hierarchy, and by using '::is_some_type()'
      virtual functions, which does not always match the type hierarchy.

Properties
----------

Properties have zero or one words as their arguments. The number of arguments
are defined per property per type. The content of the argument word is defined
by the implementation of the property and can contain mutiple values, as
described above in Strings.

Properties are inherited from super types. They can be limited to certain types
by calls to 'MyType->is_some_type()'. All properties are optional, some are
mutually exclusive.

Note: It is possible that the same peroperty by name has different arguments
      when used in a different type.
