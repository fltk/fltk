CHANGES IN FLTK 1.3.5					RELEASED: Mar 03 2019

Bug fixes and other improvements

	- Updated CHANGES for release, removed one wrong entry


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.3.5rc2				RELEASED: Feb 17 2019

Bug fixes and other improvements

	- Fix Xcode FLTK project for use under macOS 10.14


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.3.5rc1				RELEASED: Feb 11 2019

New features and enhancements (highlights)

	- Add support for macOS 10.13 "High Sierra" and 10.14 "Mojave".
	- Add FL/platform.H for compatibility with FLTK 1.4 and higher.
	- Improve OpenGL(3+) support.
	- Improve Cairo support and (CMake) Cairo detection.

Bug fixes and other improvements

        - Fix for STR 3473 (and its duplicate STR 3507) to restore configure-based
          builds on recent Linux/Unix distributions where the freetype-config
          command has been replaced by pkg-config.
	- Fix Fl_Tree::insert() with pos out ouf range (issue #18).
	- Fix Fl_GIF_Image Color Table handling (STR 3491).
	- Make sure not to access Fl_Menu_ widgets if the widget gets
	  deleted while the menu (pulldown) is open (STR 3503).
	- Fix CMake build (fluid) on case sensitive macOS file systems.
	- Windows/OpenGL: improve pixel format detection (STR 3119).
	- Add support for macOS 10.14 "Mojave": all drawing to windows is done
	  through "layer-backed views" when the app is linked to SDK 10.14.
	- MacOS platform: fix regression in macOS 10.13 where an unbundled app
	  had its system menu bar unresponsive.
	- MacOS 10.10 platform: Fl_Window::fullscreen() and fullscreen_off()
	  no longer call Fl_Window::hide() + Fl_Window::show().
	  The new procedure essentially resizes the window, as done on
	  the X11+EWMH and Windows platforms. This improves in particular
	  the possibility to turn an Fl_Gl_Window fullscreen on and off.
	- MacOS platform: Support \r\n as end of line used by recent
	  MS Office apps in clipboard.
	- Fix Fl_Text_Editor overstrike mode (STR 3463).
	- More consistent and optimized "gleam" scheme box drawing.
	- Fix a MinGW build error with new MinGW versions as of Feb 2018
	  (undefined S_OK and __FD_ISSET), see STR 3454.
	- Windows/CMake: Add missing definition of WIN32 for Windows builds.
	  This seems to be necessary for VS2017 and other compilers that
	  don't #define WIN32, but FLTK relies on this preprocessor macro.
	  Autoconf/configure and bundled IDE files #define WIN32 as well.
	- Fix illegal memory access after free when closing fluid (valgrind
	  reports "Invalid read of size 4"), see also STR 3427.
	- Fix crash when closing fluid with Fl_Table (STR 3427).
	- Fix ignored buffer pre-allocation (requestedSize) in Fl_Text_Buffer.
	  See fltk.general "Fl_Text_Buffer constructor bug" on Dec 5, 2016.
	- Fix Fl_Browser background and text color parsing (STR 3376).
	- Fix Windows CreateDC/DeleteDC mismatch (STR 3373).
	- Update bundled configure scripts config.guess and config.sub.
	- Fix configure --enable-cairo --enable-cairoext,
	  see report in fltk.general:
	  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fltkgeneral/x80qQ6wt0s4
	- Fix macOS timer implementation (STR 3387).
	- Fix drop-to-FLTK-widget under MSWindows when the desktop is
	  rescaled (STR 3390).
	- Add support for macOS 10.13 "High Sierra". Subwindows don't
	  move correctly under 10.13 without this fix.


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.3.4-1					RELEASED: Nov 15 2016

Bug fixes and other improvements

	- Fix Windows IDE solutions VisualC2008 and VisualC2010 to
	  build properly if the FLTK source directory is located
	  in a path that contains spaces.

	Note: this is a source tar file update that is only necessary
	if you build one of the above mentioned Visual Studio IDE
	solutions in a path with spaces. Nothing else changed, no
	documentation updates.


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.3.4					RELEASED: Nov 11 2016

Bug fixes and other improvements

	- Fix test/native-filechooser help display artifact (STR #3349).
	- MacOS: fix a crash when closing a fullscreen window.
	- Accept empty Fl_Pixmap in Fl_RGB_Image c'tor (STR #3348).
	- MacOS: fix drawing error when a window containing a hidden subwindow
	  is changed to fullscreen (error visible with the tabs test program).
	- MacOS: fix possible crash when enabling fullscreen in test/scroll.
	- Add a snapshot of known STR's and RFE's (KNOWN_BUGS.html).

CHANGES IN FLTK 1.3.4rc3				RELEASED: Oct 31 2016

	Bug fixes and other improvements

	- Fix string truncation in fluid (STR #2722 continued).
	- MacOS: fix a small problem where the Command-Quit menu hotkey
	  may not work if Fl_Native_File_Chooser is used before any
	  window is shown.


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.3.4rc2				RELEASED: Oct 24 2016

	Bug fixes and other improvements

	- Make sure the "File Systems" menu item of Fl_File_Chooser
	  lists "/" as the first mounted file system (Linux/Unix platform).
	- Added line numbers to fluid Edit -> Show Source Code viewer.
	- Improved fluid's template handling (STR #3335).


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.3.4rc1				RELEASED: Oct 17 2016

	New features and extensions

	- Added support for Mac OS 10.11 "El Capitan" and 10.12 "Sierra".
	- Added full support of true subwindows to the Mac OS X platform.
	  Window nesting to any depth is possible. An Fl_Gl_Window window or
	  subwindow can contain Fl_Window's as subwindows.
	- Fluid now supports external editors (STR #3213)
	  See: Edit -> GUI Settings -> Use external editor
	- Added method Fl_Widget::is_label_copied().
	- Added methods Fl_Copy_Surface::w(), Fl_Copy_Surface::h(),
	  and Fl_Copy_Surface::draw_decorated_window().
	- Added method Fl_Image_Surface::draw_decorated_window().
	- Added method Fl_Shared_Image *Fl_Image_Surface::highres_image()
	  to draw into a high-resolution bitmap image (Mac OS X only).
	- Added support for OpenGL version 3 and later.
	- Added method Fl_Mac_App_Menu::custom_application_menu_items()
	  allowing customization of the application menu (Mac OS X only).
	- Added 'fluid -u' command-line switch to upgrade fluid files in
	  batch mode. This option opens a fluid ('.fl') file and saves it
	  overwriting the old file with the current syntax and library version
	  number. Use with care (input file is overwritten unconditionally).
	- Added FL_ZOOM_GESTURE gesture for OS X (only). Needs implementation
	  on other platforms.
	- Added FL_ABI_VERSION, FL_API_VERSION, Fl::abi_version(), and
	  Fl::api_version(). Constants can be used to determine the compiled
	  FLTK version. Functions can be used to find the linked library version.
	- Added Fl::abi_check() method to test if the runtime (linked)
	  ABI version is correct.
	- Added Fl_Image::fail() to test if an image was loaded successfully
	  to allow for easier error detection when loading images (STR #2873).
	- Added line numbers to fluid's source code viewer for New -> Code

	New configuration options (ABI version)

	- FLTK's ABI version can now be configured with 'configure', CMake, or
	  by editing a supplied file when using the bundled IDE projects.
	  See documentation in README.abi-version.txt.

	1.3.4 ABI FEATURES

	- Added deactivated user icon to Fl_Tree.
	- Added Fl_Shared_Image::scale(width, height) which gives a shared
	  image its own drawing size, independently of the size of the
	  underlying image. This improves image drawing on high resolution
	  surfaces such as Laser printers, PDF files, and Apple retina displays.

	Other improvements

	- Configure now correctly sets HAVE_* variables only if both the
	  library and the header files were found. The configuration process
	  is aborted if Xft was requested explicitly with --enable-xft and
	  Xft was not found. The configuration summary now shows _found_
	  options as opposed to requested options.
	- Improved drawing of rounded box (STR #2943).
	- Full support of Apple 'retina' displays for which one drawing unit
	  corresponds to two pixels.
	- The Mac OS X platform no longer uses the deprecated AGL
	  (Apple GL library) to draw OpenGL data. Instead, it uses standard
	  Cocoa APIs. This allows FLTK to support drawing GL scenes at high
	  resolution when an Fl_Gl_Window is mapped to a 'retina' display.
	- Added Fl_Gl_Window::pixel_w(), Fl_Gl_Window::pixel_h(), and
	  Fl_Gl_Window::pixels_per_unit() useful for high resolution OpenGL windows.
	- fl_read_image() now captures all pixels within the rectangle
	  described by its arguments, whether they belong to a GL scene
	  or not (STR #3142). It also captures subwindows of GL windows.
	- Fl::delete_widget() now hides the widget or window immediately
	  (i.e. when called) - only destruction is delayed as before.
	- FLTK header files don't expose X11 definitions in user code any more
	  unless requested by including FL/x.H explicitly or implicitly.
	- The PostScript code output when printing images under Linux/Unix
	  is now much smaller by using lossless compression techniques.
	- The Linux/Unix printer dialog now uses BSD-style printing commands
	  (lpr/lpq) when SystemV-style commands (lp/lpstat) are not available.
	- Drawing alpha-blended images under X11 is now accelerated with
	  Xrender.
	- The font used for the FL_COURIER font family was changed on the Mac OS X
	  platform from 'Courier New' to 'Courier' because it was too thin.
	- Text drawing on the Mac platform supports Unicode 'variation selectors'
	  in the range [0xFE00-0xFE0F].
	- Added a Mac OS implementation of Fl_Window::wait_for_expose() that
	  became necessary with Mac OS 10.10 "Yosemite".
	- Added the libfltk target to the Xcode project producing a static
	  version of the FLTK library (Mac OS X).
	- Restored the possibility to call Fl::set_font() before main() starts.
	- Allow using the --enable-x11 configure option on the Mac OS platform
	  which produces an X11 version of the FLTK library (don't use unless
	  you know what you're doing).
	- FLTK code and fluid-generated code can be used in static initializers.
	- Added light gray separator line to fluid's widget browser (STR #2997).
	- Improved tooltip behavior for huge tooltips: remove flicker, support
	  key/mouse dismiss (STR #2650).
	- Modifier key names displayed in shortcut labels can now be localized.
	  See documentation of fl_shortcut_label(). You can set modifier key
	  names for Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and Meta by assigning global string
	  pointers to your translated modifier key names.
	- Many documentation improvements and fixes.
	- Fixed many compiler warnings (STR #2988).
	- Fluid now generates code with less compiler warnings (STR #2813).
	- Many CMake improvements and fixes. Note: CMake is mostly operating
	  now, but not yet recommended for production use. Please test and
	  report issues.
	- Updated bundled zlib from 1.2.5 to 1.2.8.
	- Updated bundled libjpeg from jpeg-8c to jpeg-9a.


	Bug fixes

	- Fix potential crash when using keyboard navigation on Fl_Tabs
	  widget without children (STR #3333).
	- Fix potential crash if Fl_Window::icon(NULL) was called to clear
	  (reset) a window icon. This is now legal and documented behavior.
	  The same applies to Fl_Window::default_icon().
	- Allow widget callback to be NULL, i.e. no callback (STR #2835).
	- Fixed Fl_Help_View buffer overflow (STR #3275).
	- Fl_Browser now correctly adjusts its scrollbars when the default
	  text size is changed with textsize(int) (STR #3057).
	- Fixed Fl_Text_Display/Fl_Text_Editor slow scrolling, line number
	  display, wrap mode "hiding" text behind scrollbars, and more
	  scrollbar handling (alignment) (STR #3272).
	- Fixed valgrind warning (uninitialized variable) in Fl_Window.
	  Visible only with FLTK_ABI_VERSION >= 10303, since FLTK 1.3.3.
	- Fixed Windows drag'n'drop not showing insert position if the drop
	  target is inside the same window or process (STR #3209).
	- Fixed undefined reference building shared cairo library (STR #3276).
	- Fixed Fl_Browser if text argument to some methods is NULL (STR #3269).
	- Fixed missing image release in fluid (STR #2840).
	- Fixed out-of-bounds memory access in fluid (STR #3263).
	- Fixed trailing white space in fluid .fl files (STR #3239).
	- Several box types were not drawn correctly when deactivated.
	  The background color for deactivated widgets is now correct:
	  fl_inactive(color()) (STR #2907).
	- Fix inconsistent interpretation of ld() in image handling
	  (STR #3308). This is a minor issue since ld() is usually 0 or
	  w()*d(). Documentation has been fixed, and ld() handling is now
	  consistent in Fl_(RGB_)Image and fl_draw_image() and friends. See
	  documentation of Fl_Image and Fl_RGB_Image for more information.
	- Fixed Fl_Pixmap (background) drawing to respect the clip region
	  (STR #3206).
	- Fixed reading .pbm image files: 1 is now interpreted as black,
	  and images whose width are a multiple of 8 are correctly read.
	  Note: if you relied on the faulty behavior you may need to fix
	  your image files.
	- Restored window background drawing, particularly the 'plastic'
	  scheme's background (STR #3059). This was a regression since
	  FLTK 1.3.0.
	- Prevent sending (FL_SHORTCUT) events to inactive widgets (STR #3216).
	- Fixed button label clipping (STR #3237).
	- Fixed Fl_Menu_::item_pathname() handling of descending submenu
	  pointers (STR #3177).
	- Fl_Text_Display: style buffer colors are no longer manipulated by
	  fl_contrast() for normal text drawing (fltk.coredev thread started
	  04/08/15, Subject: "RFC: Fl_Text_Display style buffer color weirdness")
	- Fl_Tree::deactivate() now affects draw color of items (must have
	  ABI 1.3.3 or higher enabled). For icons to draw deactivated,
	  enable ABI 1.3.4. (test/tree has a 'deactivate tree' button)
	- Fl_Tree::find_item() did not find items if the pathname contained
	  identical strings (STR #3234).
	- Fixed possible bad border effect when a set of radio menu items
	  is located first in its menu (STR #3176): Fl_Menu_Item::set_only()
	  is deprecated and replaced by Fl_Menu_::set_only(Fl_Menu_item*).
	- Restore the correct state of mouse buttons and keyboard modifier keys
	  after closing a file or printer dialog (STR #3221).
	- Fix for deactivate colors issue with Fl_Text_Display/Editor (STR #3219).
	- Fixed issue with MSWindows platform where the program kept running
	  after closing all its windows (STR #3165).
	- Fix potential buffer overflow (MSWindows: BEX64 error) and problem with
	  MSWindows environment variables "HOME"(MinGW) vs. "UserProfile"(DOS)
	- Fix issue with MSWindows platform where a window would decrease
	  in size after each close/open (STR #3167).
	- Fix undefined reference XGetUtf8FontAndGlyph (STR #3191).
	- Fix potential keyboard hangup (STR #3192).
	- Fix for: .xbm images were not previewed (STR #3131).
	- Fixed crash on Mac platform when resizing a not yet shown() Fl_Gl_Window.
	- Fixed potential Windows GDI leak (STR #3254).
	- Fixed Linux/Unix potential program hang when dialog pops up while
	  a menu is open (STR #3179).
	- Fixed a crash when a Unix/Linux program calls take_focus() before any
	  window has been show()n.
	- Fixed an error on the Mac platform when drawing to an Fl_Image_Surface
	  object without using the Fl_Image_Surface::draw() method.
	- Fixed STR #3268 where a fullscreen window could become relocated
	  behind the menu bar and dock (Mac OS only).
	- Fixed STR #3207: ^C not working when numlock or capslock is on.
	- Fixed code editor in Fluid (STR #3184).
	- Fixed a potential hangup of the Fl::awake() queue under Windows if
	  a window is resized or moved while the Fl::awake() message is sent
	  (STR #3143).
	- Fixed a regression: restore the possibility to call
	  fl_draw_image(buf,X,Y,W,H,D,L) with negative D and/or L arguments.
	- Fixed overflow in Fl_Valuator::precision(int) to 0...9 (STR #3280).

	  line numbers and word wrapping (on/off) in example test/editor.cxx.
	- On Linux/Unix, class Fl_Native_File_Chooser uses file dialogs from
	  the Gnome environment (provided by the libgtk dynamic library) if
	  available, and falls back to Fl_File_Chooser if not (STR #3088).
	  Use option Fl::OPTION_FNFC_USES_GTK to enable/disable this feature.
	- New support for the Mac OS text input system that deals with character
	  composition and input of languages with large character sets (e.g.
	  Chinese and Japanese). This implementation has been reported to work
	  well for Chinese. Superficial testing suggests it's also operational
	  for Japanese. In-depth testing remains needed though.

	Other improvements

	- Many CMake improvements (e.g. STR #2962, 2977, 2994, 3045, 3055).
	- Some autoconf, configure improvements.
	- Removed 1024 bytes constraint in labels and browser lines (STR #2990).
	- Mac OS version of Fl_Native_File_Chooser: when using filters in a
	  save file dialog, the output file extension gets changed when the
	  user modifies the output file type.
	- Many Mac OS X improvements related to Fl_Sys_Menu_Bar.
	- Improved Mac OS X keyboard handling of special keys or combinations.
	- General Mac OS X improvements, incl. high resolution (Retina)
	  displays, and support up to Mac OS X 10.10.
	- Documentation improvements and clarifications.
	- Printing support improvements, including GL windows.
	- Many improvements related to Fl_Tree (some of them only as ABI
	  breaking features, see below).
	- Some static data has been made 'const' to improve memory usage
	  with shared libraries.
	- Don't grab navkeys with modifiers (CTRL, ALT), as the application
	  may want them (STR #3104).
	- Check compiler support of -fvisibility, -fvisibility-inlines-hidden,
	  and use it, if available. Reduces shared library size.
	- Drag'n'drop behaves better now: if text is dropped in the widget it
	  comes from, then it works like cut and paste.
	- Other improvements of DND handling when dragging text from other
	  applications, e.g. Firefox and Thunderbird.
	- Windows message WM_QUIT is processed like SIGTERM, i.e. as a
	  request to terminate the program.
	- Fluid no longer closes the code window when hitting ESC (STR #2997).
	- Improved Fl_Widget::when() handling in Fl_Tabs (STR #2939).
	- Improved support for more recent compilers (clang and gcc) that
	  issue more warnings, and fixed some 32-/64-bit compilation issues.

	- Fixed access of protected member under Linux/Unix (STR #2903).
	- Fixed various Mac specific OpenGL issues (STR #2944)
	- Fixed PostScript printing with non-english locale (STR #3130).
	- Fixed a regression in Fl_File_Chooser since FLTK 1.1.8: the
	  Enter key now selects the file again.

	  input filters (STR #3101).
	- Fixed out-of-bounds memory access in Fl_Text_Display (STR #2730).

    1.3.3 ABI FEATURES

	To enable the following ABI features, put:
	#define FLTK_ABI_VERSION 10303
	..at the top of your FL/Enumerations.H and rebuild FLTK and your app.

	- Added Fl_Window::shape(const Fl_Image*) to create arbitrarily-shaped
	  windows
	- Made Fl_Help_View::handle() public and Fl_Help_View::draw() protected
	  to enable inheritance and for consistency (STR #2834).
	  Note: both methods were private.
	- Made Fl_Scroll::recalc_scrollbars() protected so that it can be used
	  in derived widgets to calculate scrollbar visibility and positions.
	- Added Fl_Table::tab_cell_nav() for controlling Tab key navigation of table
	- Added Fl_Tree::get_selected_items(), returns the selected items as an array
        - Added Fl_Tree::item_draw_callback(), letting one define a custom draw
	  function for Fl_Tree_Item's.
	- Fl_Tree: various related changes:
	    o Added horizontal scrollbar
	    o Separated draw() and tree size calculation
	    o Added new public methods:
	        > resize()           -- uses optimized dim calc, avoids tree recalc
		> next_item()        -- added parameters: direction, visibility
		> extend_selection() -- added parameters, improved algorithm
		> calc_dimensions()  -- calc tix/y/w/h, tox/y/w/h and scrollbars
		> calc_tree()        -- calc tree_w/tree_h
		> recalc_tree()      -- schedules calc_tree()
		> first_visible_item(), last_visible_item(), next_visible_item()
		> first_selected_item(), last_selected_item(), next_selected_item()
	    o Added protected variables:
	        > _tix/y/w/h      -- tree widget 'inner' dimension
		> _tox/y/w/h      -- tree widget 'outer' dimension
		> _tree_w,_tree_h -- entire tree hierarchy width/height
	    o Deprecated:
	        > item_clicked() -- use callback_item() instead
		> first_visible() -- use first_visible_item() instead
		> last_visible() -- use last_visible_item() instead

	- Fl_Tree_Item: various related changes:
	    o Added Fl_Tree ptr: needed for auto-recalc when item modified directly
	    o Added new methods tree(), recalc_tree()
	    o Added new ctor that accepts Fl_Tree*
	    o draw() parameters changed to include tree size calculations
	    o Deprecated:
	       > ctor using Fl_Tree_Prefs parameter (Fl_Tree* version better,
	         and must be used for 1.3.3 ABI features to work correctly)
	       > next_displayed() -- use next_visible() instead
	       > prev_displayed() -- use prev_visible() instead
	- test/tree: added tests for newly added features
