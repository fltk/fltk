Changes in FLTK 1.4.0					Released: ??? ?? 2017

  General Information about this Release

  - FLTK 1.4.0 is based on FLTK 1.3.4 (released Nov 15 2016),
    see CHANGES_1.3 for more information.

  - CMake is the primary supported build system in FLTK 1.4.0 and later.
    CMake can be used to generate Makefiles, IDE project files, and
    several other build systems by using different "generators" provided
    by CMake (for instance Ninja, CodeBlocks, Eclipse, KDevelop3, Xcode, etc.).
    See README.CMake.txt for more information.

  - autoconf/configure is still supported by the FLTK team for backwards
    compatibility with older systems that lack CMake support.


  New Features and Extensions

  - (add new items here)
  - Fl_Text_Selection got a new method length() and returns 0 in length()
    and in all offsets (start(), end(), position()) if no text is selected
    (selected() == false). The behavior in FLTK 1.3 and earlier versions
    (returning undefined values if !selected()) was confusing.
  - Added support for MacOS 10.13 "High Sierra".
  - New method Fl_Group::bounds() replaces Fl_Group::sizes() which is now
    deprecated. Fl_Group::bounds() uses the new class Fl_Rect that contains
    widget coordinates and sizes x(), y(), w(), and h() (STR #3385).
    Documentation for bounds() and its internal structure was added.
  - X11 platform: Added support for HiDPI displays and for rescaling any window
    at run-time under user control. Under the gnome desktop, FLTK applications
    detect the current gnome scaling factor and use it to scale all FLTK windows.
    Under other desktops, the FLTK_SCALING_FACTOR environment variable can be
    used to set the starting scaling factor of all FLTK applications.
    In addition, it is possible to rescale all FLTK windows mapped to a screen
    by typing ctrl-'+' (enlarge), ctrl-'-' (shrink) or ctrl-'0' (back to starting
    factor value). Windows moved between screens adjust to the scaling factor of
    their screen. This supports desktops mixing screens with distinct resolutions.
    [HiDPI displays have been supported since FLTK 1.3.3 for the WIN32 and MacOS platforms].
  - New method shadow(int) allows to disable the shadows of the hands
    of Fl_Clock, Fl_Clock_Output, and derived widgets.
  - New method Fl_Tabs::tab_align() allows to set alignment of tab labels,
    particularly to support icons on tab labels (STR #3076).
  - Added '--enable-print' option to configure effective under X11 platforms
    and with 'yes' default value. Using '--enable-print=no' removes print
    and PostScript support from the FLTK library, thus reducing its size.
  - Added Fl_Surface_Device::push_current(new_surface) and
    Fl_Surface_Device::pop_current() to set/unset the current surface
    receiving graphics commands.
  - X11 platform: Added support for drawing text with the pango library
    which allows to draw most scripts supported by Unicode, including CJK
    and right-to-left scripts. The corresponding CMake option is
    OPTION_USE_PANGO. The corresponding configure option is --enable-pango.
    This option is OFF by default.

  New Configuration Options (ABI Version)

  - FLTK's ABI version can be configured with 'configure' and CMake.
    See documentation in README.abi-version.txt.


  1.4.0 ABI FEATURES

  - None. FLTK 1.4.0 has a new ABI, breaking 1.3.x ABI.


  Other Improvements

  - (add new items here)
  - The blocks demo program got a new keyboard shortcut (ALT+SHIFT+H) to
    reset the user's high score. It is now slower than before in higher
    levels, hence you can expect higher scores (due to a bug fix in the
    timer code). You can use the '+' key to increase the level at all times.
  - Some methods of Fl_Tabs are now virtual and/or protected for easier
    subclassing without code duplication (STR #3211 and others).
    To be continued...
  - Separated Fl_Input_Choice.H and Fl_Input_Choice.cxx (STR #2750, #2752).
  - Separated Fl_Spinner.H and Fl_Spinner.cxx (STR #2776).
  - New method Fl_Spinner::wrap(int) allows to set wrap mode at bounds if
    value is changed by pressing or holding one of the buttons (STR #3365).
  - Fl_Spinner now handles Up and Down keys when the input field has
    keyboard focus (STR #2989).
  - Renamed test/help.cxx demo program to test/help_dialog.cxx to avoid
    name conflict with CMake's auto-generated target 'help'.
  - Many documentation fixes, clarifications, and enhancements.
