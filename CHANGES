CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.5

    - Fl_win32.cxx defined WM_MOUSE_LEAVE instead of WM_MOUSELEAVE.
    - Fl_get_key_win32.cxx needed to include <ctype.h>
    - gl_draw_pixmap.cxx needed a pointer cast for ANSI C++.
    - Fl_Repeat_Button didn't always delete its timeout.
    - Now keep track of the current OpenGL context; this provides
      significant performance improvements for OpenGL applications
      with a single context.

CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.4

    - Fl_Roller didn't handle a width and height of 0.
    - filename_list() fix for FreeBSD.
    - Fixed RPM install docos - needed "--install" option...
    - Fl_Browser_ wouldn't draw the vertical scrollbar right away if it
      added a horizontal one which covered the last line.
    - Fl_Tabs problems - single-character labels don't show up (problem in
      measure_tabs() or measure_label() methods?), and doesn't clear top
      tab area before drawing tabs.
    - Fl_Browser needs a destructor.
    - fl_draw_label() quoted characters between 0x80 and 0xa0, which
      caused problems for some programs using the WinANSI character set.
    - FLUID didn't handle declared class destructors.
    - Fixed another WIN32 cut/paste bug.
    - Fl_Tabs didn't work properly when there was only 1 tab.
    - Fl_Menu::add() didn't delete the old array.
    - Fl_Repeat_Button didn't delete its timeout when disabled.
    - fl_draw() would crash if no font was set (now defaults to
      a 14-pixel Helvetica font)
    - Can't forward declare classes; need to check for "class ", "struct ",
      "union ", etc.  See Bill's message
    - Added #pragma around xlib.h for IRIX
    - FL_KEYBOARD events have the correct x/y when sent to child X
      windows. Note that if you worked around this bug by adjusting the
      x/y yourself you will have to change your code. In addition all
      events have the correct x/y when sent to the grab() widget.  And
      the code to do all this was simplified a lot.
    - The XPM code didn't handle named colors with spaces in the names.
    - Pressing ESCape closed the window with pointer focus, even if there
      was a modal window open (now closes the modal window).
    - Fluid no longer produces trigraphs accidentally in the image data.
    - Fluid uses string constant concatenation to produce shorter image
      data.
    - The Fl_Group deletion code crashed if there was exactly one child
      widget.
    - Simulated overlays in single-buffered Fl_Gl_Windows now draw
      correctly (though very slowly as it requires the entire window to
      be redrawn to erase the overlay).  This fix ported our Digital
      Domain programs better to systems with no overlay hardware.
    - Added support for extern "C" declarations in FLUID.
    - Added Fl_Pack support to FLUID.
    - Fixed the order of #include's in FLUID generated header files.
    - Fixed detection of vsnprintf and snprintf under HP-UX 10.20 once
      and for all.
    - The checkers demo did not compile with GCC 2.95
    - FLUID didn't output virtual destructors properly.
    - Added inline "make_visible()" method to Fl_Browser.
    - Fl::wait() now returns immediately if any timeouts are
      called.
    - 16-bit XPM files are now properly handled.
    - Fl_Window::resize() was missing FL_EXPORT (caused problems
      with Windows DLLs)
    - FLUID was writing extern declarations twice.
    - New FLUID arrow key functionality: arrows move by one pixel, shift+arrow
      resizes, ctrl+arrow steps by grid

CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.3

    - Documentation updates
    - Fl_Browser::bottomline(size) didn't scroll to the bottom
      if the second-to-last line was visible.
    - fl_wait() didn't poll FDs properly for WIN32.
    - Fixed DLL definitions for BC++.
    - FLUID now handles nested classes properly.
    - The "connect" demo now does a wait() for the PPP process
      so that you aren't left with a lot of zombie processes.
    - Fixed the FLTK colormap to use FF instead of F4 for full
      intensity values.
    - Minor change to scrollbar drawing code to match other
      toolkits.
    - New selections would cancel themselves out in WIN32.
    - The header file links were broken in the IRIX
      distributions.
    - fl_elapsed() now always uses GetClockTick() for WIN32.
    - fl_display is now initialized to GetModuleHandle(NULL) -
      this fixes problems people had with Cygwin and MingW32.
    - WinMain() is no longer compiled in with Cygwin and
      MingW32; it wasn't being used for those compilers anyways.
    - Added Solaris compiler options to configure script.
    - Fl_Value_Input wouldn't update properly if you set the
      value from a callback.
    - Fl_Tile wouldn't resize if the resizeable widget was the
      last child.
    - Was missing #include <ctype.h> and #include <stdlib.h> in
      several files, which caused problems on some platforms.
    - Fixed another case where Fl_Browser_ could get in an
      infinite resizing loop.
    - Fl_win32.cxx now includes <FL/filename.H> to export missing
      DLL symbols.
    - Fluid didn't handle member functions that include the
      scope operator.
    - Fl_Chart was dividing by 0 if there were no data samples
      or if they were all the same (min == max).

CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.2

    - XDBE is now enabled for IRIX 6.[234] as well as 6.5.
    - FLUID didn't write the when() condition properly.
    - Tab/space/backtab/backspace can be used to navigate
      through menus.
    - Changed $(DSONAME) in the src/Makefile to "libfltk.so.1
      libfltk.sl.1".
    - Fl_Browser could read past the end of the string when
      computing the item height.
    - Fl_Browser could get in an infinite loop when checking to
      see if scrollbars needed to be displayed.
    - FLUID now honors the return type of the outermost widget. 
      This was a problem when substituting Fl_Group in an
      Fl_Window widget.
    - Fl_Menu_::copy() wasn't allocating a power of 2 for the
      array size.
    - FLWM would crash if fl_xmousewin was deleted.
    - The fast_slow demo now uses output widgets.
    - Timers under WIN32 were unreliable.

CHANGES SINCE FLTK 1.0.1

    - Documentation updates
    - The Visual C++ project files didn't include fl_add_idle.cxx.
    - LIBRARY/DSO name inconsistencies in src/Makefile.
    - src/Makefile didn't clean the DSO.
    - The valuator demo now has only a single callback.
    - The code looked for HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H, but the
      config file uses HAVE_SYS_SELECT.
    - Fl_Image redraw not quite right under X11 or WIN32
    - Problems with timeouts & cube demo under WIN32
    - FLUID problems with inline functions.
    - Documentation fixes...
    - Fl_Browser::item_height() didn't handle blank lines or
      non-default fonts properly.
    - FL/math.h didn't have #ifndef...#define...#endif guards
      against multiple inclusion...
    - Fl_Menu_::copy() fix - didn't allocate power of 2...
    - Fl::damage() now remains true until all windows are actually
      redrawn.
    - Fl_Widget destructor, hide(), and deactivate() methods no longer
      send FL_LEAVE, FL_RELEASE, or FL_UNFOCUS events to the widget
      (which could cause applications to crash).
    - FLUID now outputs symbolic names for align() and when().
    - Fixed select() to use maxfd + 1 instead of maxfd.
    - Added "Fl::remove_fd(fd, when)" function so you can remove the
      read and write callbacks separately.
    - The Fl::add_fd() and Fl::add_timeout() arrays are now dynamically
      allocated.
    - FLUID didn't always turn the FL_SUBMENU flag on for submenu titles.
    - The "extra code" in FLUID now is placed before the "o->end()" call
      for Fl_Group and its derived classes.
    - You can now set a FL_Window widget's class in FLUID to Fl_Group to
      generate a function or class that builds part of a GUI (i.e. no window).
    - FLUID now displays "Save file before exiting?" with the standard yes,
      no, and cancel buttons rather than "Discard changes?".
    - Fl_Menu_::add() now works with any type of menu, even one set with
      the menu() method.
    - The keypad keys were not always decoded properly under X11.
    - Some pointers were not being turned off when widgets were deleted,
      which caused some applications (like FLWM) to crash.
