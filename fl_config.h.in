/** \defgroup version_numbers Version Numbers

  FLTK defines some constants to help the programmer to
  find out, for which FLTK version a program is compiled.

  The following constants are defined:
  @{
*/

/**
  The major release version of this FLTK library.
  \see FL_VERSION
*/
#define FL_MAJOR_VERSION @FLTK_VERSION_MAJOR@

/**
  The minor release version for this library.

  FLTK remains mostly source-code compatible between minor version changes.
*/
#define FL_MINOR_VERSION @FLTK_VERSION_MINOR@

/**
  The patch version for this library.

  FLTK remains binary compatible between patch versions.
*/
#define FL_PATCH_VERSION @FLTK_VERSION_PATCH@

/**
  The FLTK ABI (Application Binary Interface) version number as an \em int.

  FL_ABI_VERSION is an \em int that describes the major, minor, and patch
  ABI version numbers in the same format as FL_API_VERSION.

  The ABI version number \p FL_ABI_VERSION is usually the same as the
  API version \p FL_API_VERSION with the last two digits set to '00'.

  FLTK retains the ABI (Application Binary Interface) during patch
  releases of the same major and minor versions. Examples:

  \verbatim
    FLTK Version  FL_API_VERSION  FL_ABI_VERSION  FL_VERSION (deprecated)
      1.3.0          10300           10300           1.0300
      1.3.4          10304           10300           1.0304
  \endverbatim

  Version 1.2.3 is actually stored as 10203 to allow for more than 9 minor
  and patch releases.

  The FL_MAJOR_VERSION, FL_MINOR_VERSION, and FL_PATCH_VERSION constants
  give the integral values for the major, minor, and patch releases
  respectively.

  To enable new ABI-breaking features in patch releases you can configure
  FLTK to use a higher FL_ABI_VERSION. The highest allowed version is

    FL_ABI_VERSION = FL_API_VERSION + 1

  to allow for "next version" ABI features when FLTK is built from git or
  from a snapshot (pre-release version).
