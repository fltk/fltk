Changes in FLTK 1.4.0                            Released: ??? ?? 2020

  General Information about this Release

  - FLTK 1.4.0 is based on FLTK 1.3.4 (released Nov 15 2016),
    see CHANGES_1.3.txt for more information.

  - CMake is the primary supported build system in FLTK 1.4.0 and later.
    CMake can be used to generate Makefiles, IDE project files, and
    several other build systems by using different "generators" provided
    by CMake (for instance Ninja, CodeBlocks, Eclipse, KDevelop3, Xcode, etc.).
    See README.CMake.txt for more information.

  - autoconf/configure is still supported by the FLTK team for backwards
    compatibility with older systems that lack CMake support.


  New Features and Extensions

  - (add new items here)
  - New classes Fl_SVG_File_Surface and Fl_EPS_File_Surface to save any FLTK
    graphics to SVG or EPS files, respectively.
  - New fl_putenv() is a cross-platform putenv() wrapper (see docs).
  - New Fl::keyboard_screen_scaling(0) call stops recognition of ctrl/+/-/0/
    keystrokes as scaling all windows of a screen.
  - New "Preview" switch added to the GTK native file chooser dialog
    available on the X11 platform. This requires function fl_register_images()
    to have been called.
  - New public variable Fl_Image::register_images_done allows an app. to detect
    whether function fl_register_images() has been called.
  - Fix Fl::add_timeout() under Linux (STR 3516).
  - Fix early timeouts in Fl_Clock seen in some environments (STR 3516).
  - Fl_Printer::begin_job() uses by default the Gnome print dialog on the X11
    platform when the GTK library is available at run-time. That can be turned off
    with Fl::option(OPTION_PRINTER_USES_GTK, false).
  - New member functions Fl_Paged_Device::begin_job() and begin_page()
    replace start_job() and start_page(). The start_... names are maintained
    for API compatibility.
  - New member function Fl_Image::scale(int width, int height) to set
    the drawing size of an image independently from its data size. The
    same function was previously available only for class Fl_Shared_Image
    and with FL_ABI_VERSION >= 10304. New member functions Fl_Image::data_w()
    and Fl_Image::data_h() give the width and height of the image data.
  - OpenGL draws text using textures on all platforms, when the necessary
    hardware support is present (a backup mechanism is available in absence
    of this support). Thus, all text drawable in Fl_Window's can be drawn
    in Fl_Gl_Window's (STR#3450).
  - New member functions Fl::program_should_quit(void),
    and Fl::program_should_quit(int) to support detection by the library
    of a request to terminate cleanly the program.
  - MacOS platform: the processing of the application menu's "Quit" item
    has been changed. With FLTK 1.3.x, the application terminated when all
    windows were closed even before Fl::run() of Fl::wait() could return.
    With FLTK 1.4, Fl::run() returns so the app follows its normal termination path.
  - MacOS platform: Added support for rescaling the GUI of any app at run-time
    using the command/+/-/0/ keystrokes.
  - MSWindows platform: Added support for rescaling the GUI of any app
    at run-time using the ctrl/+/-/0/ keystrokes. All applications
    detect the desktop scaling factor and automatically scale their GUI
    accordingly. This effectively renders WIN32 FLTK apps "per-monitor DPI-aware"
    whereas they were "DPI-unaware" with FLTK 1.3.4.
  - FLTK apps on the MacOS platform contain automatically a Window menu, which,
    under MacOS ≥ 10.12, allows to group/ungroup windows in tabbed form. The new
    Fl_Sys_Menu_Bar::window_menu_style() function allows to specify various
    styles for the Window menu, even not to create it.
  - New function: int fl_open_ext(const char* fname, int binary, int oflags, ...)
    to control the opening of files in binary/text mode in a cross-platform way.
  - New Fl_SVG_Image class: gives support of scalable vector graphics images
    to FLTK using the nanosvg software.
  - Fl_Text_Selection got a new method length() and returns 0 in length()
    and in all offsets (start(), end(), position()) if no text is selected
    (selected() == false). The behavior in FLTK 1.3 and earlier versions
    (returning undefined values if !selected()) was confusing.
  - Added support for MacOS 10.13 "High Sierra".
  - New method Fl_Group::bounds() replaces Fl_Group::sizes() which is now
    deprecated. Fl_Group::bounds() uses the new class Fl_Rect that contains
    widget coordinates and sizes x(), y(), w(), and h() (STR #3385).
    Documentation for bounds() and its internal structure was added.
  - X11 platform: Added support for HiDPI displays and for rescaling any window
    at run-time under user control. Under the gnome desktop, FLTK applications
    detect the current gnome scaling factor and use it to scale all FLTK windows.
    Under other desktops, the FLTK_SCALING_FACTOR environment variable can be
    used to set the starting scaling factor of all FLTK applications.
    In addition, it is possible to rescale all FLTK windows mapped to a screen
    by typing ctrl-'+' (enlarge), ctrl-'-' (shrink) or ctrl-'0' (back to starting
    factor value). Windows moved between screens adjust to the scaling factor of
    their screen. This supports desktops mixing screens with distinct resolutions.
  - New method shadow(int) allows to disable the shadows of the hands
    of Fl_Clock, Fl_Clock_Output, and derived widgets.
  - New method Fl_Tabs::tab_align() allows to set alignment of tab labels,
    particularly to support icons on tab labels (STR #3076).
  - Added Fl_Surface_Device::push_current(new_surface) and
    Fl_Surface_Device::pop_current() to set/unset the current surface
    receiving graphics commands.
  - X11 platform: Added support for drawing text with the pango library
    which allows to draw most scripts supported by Unicode, including CJK
    and right-to-left scripts. The corresponding CMake option is
    OPTION_USE_PANGO. The corresponding configure option is --enable-pango.
    This option is OFF by default.

  New Configuration Options (ABI Version)

  - The library can be built without support for reading SVG images or writing
    graphics in SVG format using the --disable-svg configure option
    or turning off OPTION_USE_SVG in CMake.
  - The library can be built without support for PostScript, thus reducing
    its size, using the --disable-print configure option or turning off
    OPTION_PRINT_SUPPORT in CMake. That makes classes Fl_PostScript_File_Device,
    Fl_EPS_File_Surface and Fl_Printer (under X11 platform only) ineffective.
  - FLTK's ABI version can be configured with 'configure' and CMake.
    See documentation in README.abi-version.txt.

  Bundled libraries

  - Bundled image libraries have been upgraded to newer versions.
    For details see README.bundled-libs.txt.

  1.4.0 ABI FEATURES

  - None. FLTK 1.4.0 has a new ABI, breaking 1.3.x ABI.


  Other Improvements

  - (add new items here)
  - Added support for macOS 11.0 "Big Sur" and for building for
    the arm64 architecture.
  - Add optional argument to Fl_Printer::begin_job() to receive
    a string describing the error when an error occurs.
  - Fix Windows-specific bug when the program tries to enlarge a
    maximized window, that would freeze the window (git issue #65).
  - Improve X11 16-bit coordinate clipping for text (STR 2798). This
    assumes that text is "small" WRT 16-bit coordinate space and clips
    text if at least one of the x/y coordinates is out of bounds.
  - Fix Fl::add_timeout() in draw() under Linux (STR 3188)
  - Class Fl_Native_File_Chooser uses in priority the file chooser dialog
    of GTK version 3 when available on the running X11 platform, and falls back
    to version 2 when V3 is not available. In contrast, GTK version 2 was used
    in priority by FLTK 1.3.x
  - Added support for macOS 10.15 "Catalina"
  - Improved documentation for '@' symbols in labels (STR #2940).
  - Fl_Roller can now be controlled via the mouse wheel (STR #3120).
  - Tooltips hide by themselves after 12 seconds (STR #2584).
  - Added widget visibility indicator to Fluid (STR #2669).
  - Added Fl_Input_::append() method (STR #2953).
  - Fix for STR#3473 (and its duplicate STR#3507) to restore configure-based
    builds on recent Linux/Unix distributions where the freetype-config
    command has been replaced by pkg-config.
  - Added support for MacOS 10.14 "Mojave": all drawing to windows is done
    through "layer-backed views" when the app is linked to SDK 10.14.
  - MacOS ≥ 10.10: Fl_Window::fullscreen() and fullscreen_off() no longer
    proceed by Fl_Window::hide() + Fl_Window::show() but essentially
    resize the window, as done on the X11+EWMH and Windows platforms.
  - Fl_Cairo_Window constructors are now compatible with Fl_Double_Window
    constructors - fixed missing constructors (STR #3160).
  - The include file for platform specific functions and definitions
    (FL/x.H) has been replaced with FL/platform.H. FL/x.H is deprecated
    but still available for backwards compatibility (STR #3435).
    FL/x.H will be removed in a (not yet specified) future FLTK release.
    We recommend to change your #include statements accordingly.
  - The Fl_Boxtype and Fl_Labeltype definitions contained enum values
    (names) with a leading underscore (e.g. _FL_MULTI_LABEL) that had to
    be used in this form. Now all boxtypes and labeltypes can and should
    be used without the leading underscore. A note was added to the enum
    documentations to make clear that the leading underscore must not be
    used in user code, although the enum documentation still contains
    leading underscores for technical reasons (internal use).
  - The blocks demo program got a new keyboard shortcut (ALT+SHIFT+H) to
    reset the user's high score. It is now slower than before in higher
    levels, hence you can expect higher scores (due to a bug fix in the
    timer code). You can use the '+' key to increase the level at all times.
  - Some methods of Fl_Tabs are now virtual and/or protected for easier
    subclassing without code duplication (STR #3211 and others).
    To be continued...
  - Separated Fl_Input_Choice.H and Fl_Input_Choice.cxx (STR #2750, #2752).
  - Separated Fl_Spinner.H and Fl_Spinner.cxx (STR #2776).
  - New method Fl_Spinner::wrap(int) allows to set wrap mode at bounds if
    value is changed by pressing or holding one of the buttons (STR #3365).
  - Fl_Spinner now handles Up and Down keys when the input field has
    keyboard focus (STR #2989).
  - Renamed test/help.cxx demo program to test/help_dialog.cxx to avoid
    name conflict with CMake's auto-generated target 'help'.
  - Many documentation fixes, clarifications, and enhancements.

  - Fix a potential crash when a program exits before it opens a window
    (Windows only, STR #3484).
  - Fix Fl_PNG_Image error handling. An error was potentially caused
    by error handling of the image library with setjmp/longjmp.

  - Fix ignored buffer pre-allocation (requestedSize) in Fl_Text_Buffer.
    See fltk.general "Fl_Text_Buffer constructor bug" on Dec 5, 2016.
  - Fix build with configure --enable-cairo --enable-cairoext,
    see this report in fltk.general:

  Removed Features

  - Bundled IDE project files (Xcode and Visual Studio) have been
    removed. Please use CMake to generate your IDE project files.
    See README.CMake.txt for more information.
  - Dropped FLTK 1.0 compatibility (macro FLTK_1_0_COMPAT). This "feature"
    was no longer usable since FLTK 1.3, hence it can be dropped safely.
