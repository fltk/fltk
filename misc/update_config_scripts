# Notes to developers:

# This script uses wget to download the scripts to the current working
# directory, and it overwrites existing files. You may also use your
# browser to view and download the files if wget is not installed on
# your system.
#
# After updating the scripts, copy config.guess and config.sub
# to the FLTK root directory, test, and eventually commit the changes:
#
# # cd to FLTK root directory
#
# $ make distclean
# $ rm -f config.guess config.sub configure
# $ cp misc/config.guess misc/config.sub .
# $ autoconf -f
# $ ./configure [options ...]
# $ make
# # test
# $ svn commit
#
