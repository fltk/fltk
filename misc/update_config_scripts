# Notes to developers:

# This script uses wget to download the scripts to the current working
# directory, and it overwrites existing files. You may also use your
# browser to view and download the files if wget is not installed on
# your system.
#
# After downloading the scripts, copy config.guess and config.sub to
# the FLTK root directory, test, and eventually commit the changes:
#
# # cd to FLTK root directory
#
# $ make distclean
# $ autoconf -f
# $ ./configure [options ...]
# $ make
# # test
# $ git add config.guess config.sub
# $ git commit
#

  echo ""
  wget -O $FILE \
    "http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=$FILE"
