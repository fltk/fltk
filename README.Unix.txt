 1  INTRODUCTION
=================

FLTK currently supports the following development environments on most Unix
platforms:

    - gcc command line tools
    - Code::Blocks
    - ...
    
The Symbol font and the Zapf Dingbats font do not work on X11. This is correct
behavior for UTF-8 platforms.



 2  PREREQUISITES
==================


 2.1  Ubuntu 10
----------------

Ubuntu Linux can be downloaded here:

  http://www.ubuntu.com/
  
If you have not done so yet, download and install Ubuntu.

Open a shell and install some software:

  sudo apt-get install g++
  sudo apt-get install gdb
  sudo apt-get install git
  sudo apt-get install autoconf
  sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
  sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev
  
These two are optional, but highly recommended:  
  
  sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
  sudo apt-get install libxft-dev

If you are planning to use the Code::Blocks IDE, also install this

  sudo apt-get install codeblocks

I like to use git to install the latest FLTK-1.3.release:

  git clone https://github.com/fltk/fltk fltk-1.3
  cd fltk-1.3
  git checkout branch-1.3

To update to the latest version, just go into the fltk-1.3 directory and type

  git pull


 2.2  Linux Mint 9
-------------------

Linux Mint 9 can be downloaded here:

  http://www.linuxmint.com/
  
If you have not done so yet, download and install Linux Mint.

Open a shell and install some software:

  sudo apt-get install g++
  sudo apt-get install gdb
  sudo apt-get install git
  sudo apt-get install autoconf
  sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
  sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev
  
These two are optional, but highly recommended:  
  
  sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
  sudo apt-get install libxft-dev

If you are planning to use the Code::Blocks IDE, also install this

  sudo apt-get install codeblocks

I like to use git to install the latest FLTK-1.3.release:

  git clone https://github.com/fltk/fltk fltk-1.3
  cd fltk-1.3
  git checkout branch-1.3

To update to the latest version, just go into the fltk-1.3 directory and type

  git pull


 2.3  Fedora 13
-------------------

Fedora 13 Linux can be downloaded here:

  http://fedoraproject.org/
  
If you have not done so yet, download and install Fedora.

Open a terminal window and install some software. In Fedora, the default user 
has no permission to call "sudo", so we will change user a few times:

  su root
  yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
  yum groupinstall "X Software Development"
  yum groupinstall "C Development Tools and Libraries"

If you are planning to use the Code::Blocks IDE, also install this

  yum install codeblocks.i686  (for 64 bit machines)

Don't forget to leave root status (Ctrl-D) before loading FLTK. To install FLTK 
for every user, you either have to set root user again, or use "visudo" to add 
yourself to the "sudo" list.

I like to use git to install the latest FLTK-1.3.release:

  git clone https://github.com/fltk/fltk fltk-1.3
  cd fltk-1.3
  git checkout branch-1.3

To update to the latest version, just go into the fltk-1.3 directory and type

  git pull


 2.8  SunOS / Solaris
----------------------

SunOS is a commercial operating system from Sun Microsystems (in 2009 the
company was sold to Oracle). SunOS is also called Solaris since version 5.
There was an open source derivative called OpenSolaris (based on Solaris 10)
that was cancelled by Oracle. The successor in spirit is called OpenIndiana
and can be downloaded from here:

  http://www.openindiana.org/

For FLTK you need at least SunOS 5.7 (aka Solaris 7). This version supports
64 bit machines and POSIX threads. For machines with 64 bit SPARC processors
it is highly recommended to use Sun compilers, the 64 bit code generated by
older versions of GCC for such machines is unusable (expect something between
horribly broken and immediate crash).

Consider using pkgsrc with this operating system. See the NetBSD section if
you want to do so.
If you have GCC and Sun compilers installed, configure your environment like
this to use the Sun compilers and pkgsrc graphics libraries:

  export CC="cc"
  export CXX="CC"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include"
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib"

To build a 64 bit FLTK library, add the following flags:

  export CFLAGS="-xarch=v9"
  export CXXFLAGS="-xarch=v9"


 2.10  HP-UX
-------------

HP-UX is a commercial operating system from HP, no free or open source
derivatives are available.

For FLTK you need at least HP-UX 11.11 and the latest patch bundles should be
installed.

Consider using pkgsrc with this operating system. See the NetBSD section if
you want to do so.


 2.11  AIX
-----------

AIX is a commercial operating system from IBM, no free or open source
derivatives are available.

For FLTK you need at least AIX 5L, I have tested version 5.1 patched to ML9.

Consider using pkgsrc with this operating system. See the NetBSD section if
you want to do so.


 2.12  NetBSD
--------------

NetBSD can be downloaded here:

  http://www.netbsd.org/

If you have not done so yet, download and install NetBSD. Ensure that the
optional distribution sets "comp" (Compiler, header files, development tools)
and x*** (X Window System) are installed.

Now install and configure pkgsrc. The current version can be downloaded here:

  http://www.pkgsrc.org/

To use the current stable version of FLTK, simply install it from pkgsrc:

  cd /usr/pkgsrc/x11/fltk13
  bmake install

For the latest development snapshot, first install the git client from pkgsrc:

  cd /usr/pkgsrc/devel/git
  bmake install

Now fetch the latest FLTK source code:

  git clone https://github.com/fltk/fltk fltk-1.3
  cd fltk-1.3
  git checkout branch-1.3

To update to the latest version, just go into the fltk-1.3 directory and type

  git pull

If you have installed JPEG and PNG libraries from pkgsrc, configure your
environment as follows so that the FLTK configure script can find them:

  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include"
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/pkg/lib"

To install GNU autoconf from pkgsrc:

  cd /usr/pkgsrc/devel/autoconf
  bmake install


 3  HOW TO BUILD FLTK USING GCC
================================


 3.1  Downloading and Unpacking
--------------------------------

Download FLTK from here:

  https://www.fltk.org/software.php

If you are familiar with "git" and like to stay current with your 
version, you will find the git access parameters at the bottom of that 
page. Unpack FLTK into a convenient location. I like to have everything in my 
dev directory:

  cd
  mkdir dev
  cd dev
  mv ~/Downloads/fltk-1.3.xxxx.tar.gz .
  tar xvfz fltk-1.3.xxxx.tar.gz
  cd fltk-1.3.xxxx
  

 3.2  Configuring FLTK
-----------------------

If you got FLTK via git then you need one extra step. Otherwise skip
over this part. Stay in your FLTK source-code directory and type the
following:

  NOCONFIGURE=1 ./autogen.sh

Now configure your FLTK installation:

  ./configure
  
ADVANCED: type "./configure --help" to get a complete list of optional 
configuration parameters. These should be pretty self-explanatory. Some
more details can be found in README. 
:END_ADVANCED

The configuration script will check your machine for the required resources
which you should have installed as described in the Prerequisites chapter.
Review the Configuration Summary, maybe take some notes.


 3.3  Building FLTK
--------------------

Now this is easy. Stay in your FLTK source-code directory and type: 

  make

The entire FLTK toolkit including many test programs will be built for you. No 
warnings should appear. If some do, please let the FLTK developer team know via
the mailing list or the bug reporting template at www.fltk.org .

Actually, as of Jan. 2019, one or two warnings will show, mostly about
deprecated declarations. Please ignore them. If you see more warnings
(depending on the compiler you are using) please consider upgrading to
FLTK 1.4.


 3.4  Testing FLTK
-------------------

After a successful build, you can test FLTK's capabilities:

  test/demo


 3.5  Installing FLTK
----------------------

If you did not change any of the configuration settings, FLTK will be installed 
in "/usr/local/include" and "/usr/local/lib" by typing

  sudo make install
  
If you are using the KDE, GNOME or XFCE desktop environments and want to call
"fluid" from the desktop menu, you will need to install additional files and
icons under "/usr/share" by typing:

  sudo make install-desktop
  
It is possible to install FLTK without superuser privileges by changing the 
installation path to a location within the user account by adding the 
"--prefix=PREFIX" parameters to the "./configure" command.


 3.6  Creating new Projects
----------------------------

FLTK provides a neat script named "fltk-config" that can provide all the flags
needed to build FLTK applications using the same flags that were used to build
the library itself. Running "fltk-config" without arguments will print a list
of options. The easiest call to compile an FLTK application from a single
source file is:

  fltk-config --compile myProgram.cxx

"fltk-config" and "fluid" will be installed in "/usr/local/bin/" by default. I
recommend that you add it to the command search path.



 4  CREATING A NEW PROJECT IN CODE::BLOCKS
===========================================

Code::Blocks is a free and popular C++ IDE in the Linux world. It also runs on
macOS and Windows. Configured correctly, it can also cross-compile between
these platforms. This chapter focuses on creating a new FLTK project for Linux, 
assuming that FLTK 1.3 was previously built and installed in its default 
location from the command line.

If not done yet, install Code::Blocks as described in the Prerequisites chapter 
above, or download it from their web site. This description is based on 
version 10.05:

  http://www.codeblocks.org/
  
Start Code::Blocks. Select File > New > Project. In the "New from template"
dialog box, click on "FLTK project" and follow the instructions.

The default project supports basic fltk. If you would like to add support for
images, OpenGL, GLUT, or Forms, add the corresponding flags --use-images,
--use-gl, --use-glut, and --use-forms respectively.

The flags are located in the "Project Build Options" dialog. To change the
compiler flags, select your project in the tree view, then select the
"Compiler Settings" tab, then "Other Options" and add the flags to
`fltk-config --cxxflags` in front of the second "`".

The linker flags are located in the "Linker Settings" tab under "Other Linker
Options". Add the flags to `fltk-config --ldstaticflags` in front of the 
second "`".

CodeBlocks can be set up to use fluid to manage modules.
The following info is from mingodad@gmail.com posted on fltk.general 06/17/2013:

"""
    I have these settings in codeblocks on linux:

    Settings -> 
      Compiler and debugging settings ->
        Other settings -> 
	  Advanced options:

    -- Add an extension (in my case "fl")

    -- On command line macro:
		cd $file_dir;  fluid -c $file

    -- Generated files  (to be further compiled):
		$file_dir/$file_name.cxx
		$file_dir/$file_name.h

    Settings -> Environment -> Files extension handling :
		Wildcard : *.fl
		To open file: Launch an external program
		External program: fluid

    With that I can double click on any fluid file I include on a project
    and it opens with fluid. When I press "run" or "build" codeblocks
    calls fluid to generate the c++ files and compiles if needed.
