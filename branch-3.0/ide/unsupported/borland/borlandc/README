Compilation of FLTK 1.1rc2 in Borland C++ Builder 6.0
(by Alexey Parshin alexeyp@m7.tts-sf.com)

FLTK library compile:
---------------------
0) Open the project group fltk.bpg. It contains all the other projects.
1) Create the directory ../obj (obj in fltk)
2) During the compilation of fltklib project I had two compile
   errors in scandir_win32.c. Just add the required type conversions:

   Line 46:
   findIn = (char *)malloc(len+5);

   Line 75:
	struct dirent **tempDir = (struct dirent **) calloc(sizeof(struct dirent*), NDir+33);
3) For some reason BCB 6.0 doesn't like the word 'DIRECTORY' so I had to replace
   it everywhere in source code and examples with '_DIRECTORY'. The case is
   very important. For instance (file Fl_File_Icon.cxx):

      icon = new Fl_File_Icon("*", Fl_File_Icon::DIRECTORY);

      replaced with

      icon = new Fl_File_Icon("*", Fl_File_Icon::_DIRECTORY);


FLTK examples compile:
---------------------
0) All the examples create an empty console window when start. I know how to
   avoid this window but it requires the modification of the examples. So I leave
   it on FLTK authors.
1) File connect.cxx doesn't support Windows - example is not generated.
2) The colbrowser example uses the color map file which is not presented on
   Windows. If you modify this example so it uses the file stolen from Linux
   you can test it.
3) The (cube, fullscreen, fractals) examples use GL which I don't have. For this 
   reason I was unable to test how it works with GL.

Your own projects in BCB 6.0:
----------------------------
1) Make sure you have 'Treat enums as integers' option checked (in project options).
2) To make it simple you can take fltk_app_template.bpr and replace bitmap.cxx in
   this project with your files.
