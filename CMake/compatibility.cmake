# The functions (and macros) in this file are defined to simplify CMake
# code that uses features not available in all supported CMake versions.
# Functions should be preferred (rather than macros) because functions
# have their own variable scope.
#
# The function must apply a workaround for older versions or not add code
# at all if there is no suitable workaround.
#
# The functions included here may be removed (with according changes of the
# calling code) or the workaround code may be removed from the implementation
# after cmake_minimum_required() has been raised to a version number greater
# than or equal to the required version.
#
# Current cmake_minimum_required() version: see <fltk-root>/CMakeLists.txt

#
# function fl_target_link_directories - add link directories to target
#
# Requires CMake version: 3.13
# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_directories.html
#
# Input:
#
# - TARGET: target to add link directories to, e.g. fluid
#
# - SCOPE: one of <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> (see CMake docs)
#
# - DIRS: quoted list of link directories (separated by ';')
#
# The 'DIRS' argument takes a standard CMake list of directories, i.e. the
# individual members must be separated by ';'. The list may be empty ("").
# If more than one directory is to be added or if the list of directories
# can be empty it *must* be quoted. This function may be called more than
# once. Each invocation adds zero, one, or more directories.
#
# Example:
#
#   fl_target_link_directories (fluid PRIVATE "${PKG_CAIRO_LIBRARY_DIRS}")
#
#   In this example 'PKG_CAIRO_LIBRARY_DIRS' is platform dependent and
#   can be an empty list.
