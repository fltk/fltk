#
# FLTKConfig.cmake - FLTK CMake configuration file for external projects.
#
# This file is generated by CMake and used to load FLTK's settings for
# an external project.
#
# It defines the following variables:
#
#  FLTK_VERSION           - FLTK version string ("x.y.z")
#  FLTK_INCLUDE_DIRS      - FLTK include directories
#  FLTK_LIBRARIES         - list of FLTK libraries built (not yet implemented)
#  FLTK_FLUID_EXECUTABLE  - needed by the function FLTK_RUN_FLUID
#                          (or the deprecated fltk_wrap_ui() CMake command)
#
# It defines the following deprecated variables for backwards
# compatibility (do not use for new projects):
#
#  FLTK_INCLUDE_DIR       - FLTK include directories (same as FLTK_INCLUDE_DIRS)
#
#  FLTK_USE_FILE          - previously used to set things up to use FLTK
#                         - deprecated since FLTK 1.3.4
#                         - will be removed in FLTK 1.4.0 or later
#
# Important note: FLTK's CMake build files are not yet complete and may be
# changed in future versions. This includes the list of defined variables
# above that may be changed if necessary.
