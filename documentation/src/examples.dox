 \page  examples        Example Source Code

The FLTK distribution contains over 60 sample applications written
in, or ported to, FLTK. If the FLTK archive you received does not
contain either an 'examples' or 'test' directory, you can download
the complete FLTK distribution from \b https://www.fltk.org/software.php .

Most of the example programs were created while testing a group of widgets.
They are not meant to be great achievements in clean C++ programming, but
merely a test platform to verify the functionality of the FLTK library.

Note that extra example programs are also available in an additional
'examples' directory, but these are \b NOT built automatically when
you build FLTK, unlike those in the 'test' directory shown below.

\subsection examples_adjuster adjuster

\par
\c adjuster shows a nifty little widget for quickly
setting values in a great range.


\subsection examples_animated animated

\par
\c animated shows a window with an animated square that shows drawing
with transparency (alpha channel).


\subsection examples_arc arc

\par
The \c arc demo explains how to derive your own widget to
generate some custom drawings. The sample drawings use the matrix
based arc drawing for some fun effects.


\subsection examples_ask ask

\par
\c ask shows some of FLTK's standard dialog boxes. Click
the correct answers or you may end up in a loop, or you may end
up in a loop, or you... .


\subsection examples_bitmap bitmap

\par
This simple test shows the use of a single color bitmap as a
label for a box widget. Bitmaps are stored in the X11 '.bmp'
file format and can be part of the source code.


\subsection examples_blocks blocks

\par
A wonderful and addictive game that shows the usage of FLTK
timers, graphics, and how to implement sound on all platforms.
\c blocks is also a good example for the Mac OS X specific
bundle format.


\subsection examples_boxtype boxtype

\par
\c boxtype gives an overview of readily available boxes and frames in FLTK.
More types can be added by the application programmer. When using themes,
FLTK shuffles boxtypes around to give your program a new look.


\subsection examples_browser browser

\par
\c browser shows the capabilities of the Fl_Browser widget.
Important features tested are loading of files, line formatting, and
correct positioning of the browser data window.


\subsection examples_button button

\par
The \c button test is a simple demo of push-buttons and callbacks.


\subsection examples_buttons buttons

\par
\c buttons shows a sample of FLTK button types.


\subsection examples_cairo_test cairo_test

\par
\c cairo_test shows a sample of drawing with Cairo in an Fl_Cairo_Window.
This program can only be built if FLTK was configured with Cairo support.


\subsection examples_checkers checkers

\par
Written by Steve Poulsen in early 1979, \c checkers shows
how to convert a VT100 text-terminal based program into a neat
application with a graphical UI. Check out the code that drags the
pieces, and how the pieces are drawn by layering. Then tell me
how to beat the computer at Checkers.


\subsection examples_clock clock

\par
The \c clock demo shows two analog clocks. The innards of
the Fl_Clock widget are pretty interesting, explaining
the use of timeouts and matrix based drawing.


\subsection examples_colbrowser colbrowser

\par
\c colbrowser runs only on X11 systems. It reads
<i>/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt</i> to show the color representation
of every text entry in the file. This is beautiful, but
only moderately useful unless your UI is written in <i>Motif</i>.


\subsection examples_color_chooser color_chooser

\par
The \c color_chooser gives a short demo of FLTK's palette based
color chooser and of the RGB based color wheel.


\subsection examples_cube cube

\par
The \c cube demo shows the speed of OpenGL. It also tests
the ability to render two OpenGL buffers into a single window,
and shows OpenGL text.


\subsection examples_CubeView CubeView

\par
\c CubeView shows how to create a UI containing OpenGL with Fluid.


\subsection examples_cursor cursor

\par
The \c cursor demo shows all mouse cursor shapes that come standard
with FLTK. The <i>fgcolor</i> and <i>bgcolor</i> sliders work only
on few systems (some version of Irix for example).


\subsection examples_curve curve

\par
\c curve draws a nice BÃ©zier curve into a custom widget. The
<i>points</i> option for splines is not supported on all platforms.


\subsection examples_demo demo

\par
This tool allows quick access to all programs in the \c test directory.
\c demo is based on the visuals of the IrixGL demo program. The menu
tree can be changed by editing <tt>test/demo.menu</tt>.


\subsection examples_device device

\par
Exercises the Fl_Image_Surface, Fl_Copy_Surface, and Fl_Printer classes to draw to an
Fl_Image object, copy graphical data to the clipboard, and for print support.
\note The clipboard.cxx program of the 'examples' directory is a clipboard watching
application that continuously displays the textual or graphical content of the system
clipboard (a.k.a pasteboard on Mac OS X) exercising Fl::paste().


\subsection examples_doublebuffer doublebuffer

\par
The \c doublebuffer demo shows the difference between a single
buffered window, which may flicker during a slow redraw, and a
double buffered window, which never flickers, but uses twice the
amount of RAM. Some modern OS's double buffer all windows automatically
to allow transparency and shadows on the desktop. FLTK is smart enough
to not tripple buffer a window in that case.


\subsection examples_editor editor

\par
FLTK has two very different text input widgets. Fl_Input
and derived classes are rather light weight, however
Fl_Text_Editor is a complete port of <i>nedit</i> (with permission).
The \c editor test is almost a full application, showing custom
syntax highlighting and dialog creation.


\subsection examples_fast_slow fast_slow

\par
\c fast_slow shows how an application can use the Fl_Widget::when()
setting to receive different kinds of callbacks.


\subsection examples_file_chooser file_chooser

\par
The standard FLTK \c file_chooser is the result of many
iterations, trying to find a middle ground between a complex
browser and a fast light implementation.


\subsection examples_fonts fonts

\par
\c fonts shows all available text fonts on the host system. If your
machine still has some pixmap based fonts, the supported sizes will
be shown in bold face. Only the first 256 fonts will be listed.


\subsection examples_forms forms

\par
\c forms is an XForms program with very few changes.
Search for "fltk" to find all changes necessary to port to fltk.
This demo shows the different boxtypes. Note that some
boxtypes are not appropriate for some objects.


\subsection examples_fractals fractals

\par
\c fractals shows how to mix OpenGL, Glut and FLTK code. FLTK supports a
rather large subset of Glut, so that many Glut applications compile just fine.


\subsection examples_fullscreen fullscreen

\par
This demo shows how to do many of the window manipulations that
are popular for games.
You can toggle the border on/off, switch between single-
and double-buffered rendering, and take over the entire
screen. More information in the source code.


\subsection examples_gl_overlay gl_overlay

\par
\c gl_overlay shows OpenGL overlay plane rendering. If no hardware
overlay plane is available, FLTK will simulate it for you.


\subsection examples_glpuzzle glpuzzle

\par
The \c glpuzzle test shows how most Glut source code compiles
easily under FLTK.


\subsection examples_hello hello

\par
\c hello: Hello, World. Need I say more? Well, maybe. This
tiny demo shows how little is needed to get a functioning application
running with FLTK. Quite impressive, I'd say.


\subsection examples_help_dialog help_dialog

\par
\c help_dialog displays the built-in FLTK help browser. The Fl_Help_Dialog
understands a subset of html and renders various image formats. This widget
makes it easy to provide help pages to the user without depending on the
operating system's html browser.


\subsection examples_icon icon

\par
\c icon demonstrates how an application icon can be set from an image.
This icon should be displayed in the window bar (label), in the task bar,
and in the task switcher (Windows: Alt-Tab). This feature is platform
specific, hence it is possible that you can't see the icon. On Unix/Linux
(X11) this can even depend on the Window Manager (WM).


\subsection examples_iconize iconize

\par
\c iconize demonstrates the effect of the window functions
hide(), iconize(), and show().


\subsection examples_image image

\par
The \c image demo shows how an image can be created on the fly.
This generated image contains an alpha (transparency) channel which
lets previous renderings 'shine through', either via true
transparency or by using screen door transparency (pixelation).


\subsection examples_inactive inactive

\par
\c inactive tests the correct rendering of inactive widgets. To see the
inactive version of images, you can check out the pixmap or image test.


\subsection examples_input input

\par
This tool shows and tests different types of text input fields based on
Fl_Input_. The \c input program also tests various
settings of Fl_Input::when().


\subsection examples_input_choice input_choice

\par
\c input_choice tests the latest addition to FLTK1, a text input
field with an attached pulldown menu. Windows users will recognize
similarities to the 'ComboBox'. \c input_choice starts up in
'plastic' scheme, but the traditional scheme is also supported.


\subsection examples_keyboard keyboard

\par
FLTK unifies keyboard events for all platforms. The \c keyboard
test can be used to check the return values of Fl::event_key()
and Fl::event_text(). It is also great to see the modifier
buttons and the scroll wheel at work. Quit this application by closing
the window. The ESC key will not work.


\subsection examples_label label

\par
Every FLTK widget can have a label attached to it. The \c label
demo shows alignment, clipping, and wrapping of text labels. Labels
can contain symbols at the start and end of the text, like <i>\@FLTK</i>
or <i>\@circle uh-huh \@square</i>.


\subsection examples_line_style line_style

\par
Advanced line drawing can be tested with \c line_style.
Not all platforms support all line styles.


\subsection examples_list_visuals list_visuals

\par
This little app finds all available pixel formats for the current X11
screen. But since you are now an FLTK user, you don't have to worry
about any of this.


\subsection examples_mandelbrot mandelbrot

\par
\c mandelbrot shows two advanced topics in one test. It creates
grayscale images on the fly, updating them via the <i>idle</i> callback
system. This is one of the few occasions where the <i>idle</i> callback
is very useful by giving all available processor time to the application
without blocking the UI or other apps.


\subsection examples_menubar menubar

\par
The \c menubar tests many aspects of FLTK's popup menu system.
Among the features are radio buttons, menus taller than the screen,
arbitrary sub menu depth, and global shortcuts.


\subsection examples_message message

\par
\c message pops up a few of FLTK's standard message boxes.


\subsection examples_minimum minimum

\par
The \c minimum test program verifies that the update regions are set
correctly. In a real life application, the trail would be avoided by
choosing a smaller label or by setting label clipping differently.


\subsection examples_native-filechooser native-filechooser

\par
The \c native-filechooser program invokes the platform specific
file chooser, if available (see Fl_Native_File_Chooser widget).


\subsection examples_navigation navigation

\par
\c navigation demonstrates how the text cursor moves from text field
to text field when using the arrow keys, tab, and shift-tab.


\subsection examples_offscreen offscreen

\par
\c offscreen shows how to draw into an offscreen image and display the
offscreen image in the program window.


\subsection examples_output output

\par
\c output shows the difference between the single line and
multi line mode of the Fl_Output widget. Fonts can be
selected from the FLTK standard list of fonts.


\subsection examples_overlay overlay

\par
The \c overlay test app shows how easy an FLTK window can
be layered to display cursor and manipulator style elements. This
example derives a new class from Fl_Overlay_Window and
provides a new function to draw custom overlays.


\subsection examples_pack pack

\par
The \c pack test program demonstrates the resizing and repositioning
of children of the Fl_Pack group. Putting an Fl_Pack into an Fl_Scroll
is a useful way to create a browser for large sets of data.


\subsection examples_pixmap pixmap

\par
This simple test shows the use of a LUT based pixmap as a label for
a box widget. Pixmaps are stored in the X11 '.xpm' file format and
can be part of the source code. Pixmaps support one transparent color.


\subsection examples_pixmap_browser pixmap_browser

\par
\c pixmap_browser tests the shared-image interface. When using the same
image multiple times, Fl_Shared_Image will keep it only once in memory.


\subsection examples_preferences preferences

\par
I do have my \c preferences in the morning, but sometimes I
just can't remember a thing. This is where the Fl_Preferences
come in handy. They remember any kind of data between program launches.


\subsection examples_radio radio

\par
The \c radio tool was created entirely with <i>fluid</i>. It
shows some of the available button types and tests radio
button behavior.


\subsection examples_resizebox resizebox

\par
\c resizebox shows some possible ways of FLTK's automatic
resize behavior.


\subsection examples_rotated_text rotated_text

\par
\c rotated_text shows how text can be rotated, i.e. drawn in any given
angle. This demo is device specific, for instance it works under X11
only if configured with Xft.


\subsection examples_resize resize

\par
The \c resize demo tests size and position functions with
the given window manager.


\subsection examples_scroll scroll

\par
\c scroll shows how to scroll an area of widgets, one of them being
a slow custom drawing. Fl_Scroll uses clipping and smart window area
copying to improve redraw speed. The buttons at the bottom of the
window control decoration rendering and updates.


\subsection examples_shape shape

\par
\c shape is a very minimal demo that shows how to create
your own OpenGL rendering widget. Now that you know that, go ahead
and write that flight simulator you always dreamt of.


\subsection examples_subwindow subwindow

\par
The \c subwindow demo tests messaging and drawing between
the main window and 'true' sub windows. A sub window is different
to a group by resetting the FLTK coordinate system to 0, 0 in the
top left corner. On Win32 and X11, subwindows have their own
operating system specific handle.


\subsection examples_sudoku sudoku

\par
Another highly addictive game - don't play it, I warned you.
The implementation shows how to create application icons,
how to deal with OS specifics, and how to generate sound.


\subsection examples_symbols symbols

\par
\c symbols are a speciality of FLTK. These little vector
drawings can be integrated into labels. They scale and rotate,
and with a little patience, you can define your own. The rotation
number refers to 45 degree rotations if you were looking at a
numeric keypad (2 is down, 6 is right, etc.).


\subsection examples_table table

\par
The \c table demo shows the features of the Fl_Table widget.


\subsection examples_tabs tabs

\par
The \c tabs tool was created with <i>fluid</i>. It tests
correct hiding and redisplaying of tabs, navigation across tabs,
resize behavior, and no unneeded redrawing of invisible widgets.

\par
The \c tabs application shows the Fl_Tabs widget
on the left and the Fl_Wizard widget on the right side
for direct comparison of these two panel management widgets.


\subsection examples_threads threads

\par
FLTK can be used in a multithreading environment. There are some
limitations, mostly due to the underlying operating system.
\c threads shows how to use Fl::lock(), Fl::unlock(), and Fl::awake()
in secondary threads to keep FLTK happy. Although locking works on all
platforms, this demo is not available on every machine.


\subsection examples_tile tile

\par
The \c tile tool shows a nice way of using Fl_Tile.
To test correct resizing of subwindows, the widget for region 1 is
created from an Fl_Window class.


\subsection examples_tiled_image tiled_image

\par
The \c tiled_image demo uses a small image as the background
for a window by repeating it over the full size of the widget.
The window is resizable and shows how the image gets repeated.


\subsection examples_tree tree

\par
The \c tree demo shows the features of the Fl_Tree widget.


\subsection examples_twowin twowin

\par
The \c twowin program tests focus transfer from one window to another window.


\subsection examples_unittests unittests

\par
\c unittests exercises all of FLTK's drawing features (e.g., text, lines,
circles, images), as well as scrollbars and schemes.


\subsection examples_utf8 utf8

\par
\c utf8 shows all fonts available to the platform that runs it, and how each
font draws each of the Unicode code points ranging between U+0020 and U+FFFF.


\subsection examples_valuators valuators

\par
\c valuators shows all of FLTK's nifty widgets to change numeric values.


\subsection examples_windowfocus windowfocus

\par
\c windowfocus shows a very special case when a new window is shown
while the focus stays in the original window.


\subsection examples_fluid fluid

\par
\c fluid is not only a big test program, but also a very
useful visual UI designer. Many parts of \c fluid were
created using \c fluid. See the \link fluid Fluid Tutorial \endlink
for more details.



\section example_applications_images Example Applications: Images

This chapter contains a few selected images of the test and example
applications listed above. It is not meant to be complete or a full
reference. The reason some images are included here is to show how
the display \b should look when running the example programs.


\subsection examples_cairo_test_image cairo_test

\par
The \c cairo_test demo program shows three shiny buttons drawn with Cairo
in an Fl_Cairo_Window.

  \image html cairo_test.png "Buttons drawn with Cairo"
  \image latex cairo_test.png "Buttons drawn with Cairo" width=8cm


\subsection examples_icon_image icon
