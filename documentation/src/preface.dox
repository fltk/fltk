 \page preface Preface

This manual describes the Fast Light Tool Kit ("FLTK")
version 1.4.0, a C++ Graphical User Interface
("GUI") toolkit for UNIX, Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X.

Version 1.4.0 introduces support for a new windowing system
under Linux/Unix: Wayland. FLTK applications under Linux/Unix
run, unchanged, as Wayland or X11 clients depending on what's
available at run-time.

Each of the chapters in this manual is designed as a tutorial for
using FLTK, while the appendices provide a convenient reference
for all FLTK widgets, functions, and operating system
interfaces.

the terms of the FLTK license provided in \ref license.</B>
