 \page  events Handling Events

This chapter discusses the FLTK event model and how to handle
events in your program or widget.

\section events_model The FLTK Event Model

Every time a user moves the mouse pointer, clicks a button,
or presses a key, an event is generated and sent to your
application. Events can also come from other programs like the
window manager.

Events are identified by the integer argument passed to a
\p handle() method that overrides the
Fl_Widget::handle()
virtual method.
Other information about the most recent event is stored in
static locations and acquired by calling the
\ref events_event_xxx.
This static information remains valid until the next event
is read from the window system, so it is ok to look at it outside
of the
\p handle()
method.

Event numbers can be converted to their actual names using the \ref fl_eventnames[] array
defined in \#include &lt;FL/names.h&gt;; see next chapter for details.

In the next chapter, the
\ref subclassing_events "MyClass::handle()"
example shows how to override the
Fl_Widget::handle()
method to accept and process specific events.

\section events_mouse Mouse Events

\subsection events_fl_push FL_PUSH

A mouse button has gone down with the mouse pointing at this
widget. You can find out what button by calling
Fl::event_button().
You find out the mouse position by calling
Fl::event_x()
and
Fl::event_y().

A widget indicates that it \e "wants" the mouse click
by returning non-zero from its
\p handle()
method, as in the
\ref subclassing_events "MyClass::handle()"
example.
It will then become the
Fl::pushed()
widget and will get \p FL_DRAG and
the matching \p FL_RELEASE events.
If
\p handle()
returns zero then FLTK will try sending the \p FL_PUSH to
another widget.

\subsection events_fl_drag FL_DRAG

The mouse has moved with a button held down. The current
button state is in
Fl::event_state().
The mouse position is in
Fl::event_x()
and
Fl::event_y().

In order to receive \p FL_DRAG events, the widget must
return non-zero when handling \p FL_PUSH.

\subsection events_fl_release FL_RELEASE

A mouse button has been released. You can find out what button by calling
Fl::event_button().

In order to receive the \p FL_RELEASE event, the widget must
return non-zero when handling \p FL_PUSH.

\subsection events_fl_move FL_MOVE

The mouse has moved without any mouse buttons held down.
This event is sent to the
Fl::belowmouse()
widget.

In order to receive \p FL_MOVE events, the widget must
return non-zero when handling \p FL_ENTER.

\subsection events_fl_mousewheel FL_MOUSEWHEEL

The user has moved the mouse wheel. The
Fl::event_dx()
and
Fl::event_dy()
methods can be used to find the amount to scroll horizontally and
vertically.

\section events_focus Focus Events

\subsection events_fl_enter FL_ENTER

The mouse has been moved to point at this widget.  This can
be used for highlighting feedback.  If a widget wants to
highlight or otherwise track the mouse, it indicates this by
returning non-zero from its
\p handle()
method. It then becomes the
Fl::belowmouse()
widget and will receive \p FL_MOVE and \p FL_LEAVE
events.

\subsection events_fl_leave FL_LEAVE

The mouse has moved out of the widget.

In order to receive the \p FL_LEAVE event, the widget must
return non-zero when handling \p FL_ENTER.

\subsection events_fl_focus FL_FOCUS

This indicates an \e attempt to give a widget the keyboard focus.

If a widget wants the focus, it should change itself to
display the fact that it has the focus, and return non-zero from its
\p handle() method. It then becomes the Fl::focus() widget and gets
\p FL_KEYDOWN, \p FL_KEYUP, and \p FL_UNFOCUS events.

The focus will change either because the window manager changed which
window gets the focus, or because the user tried to navigate using tab,
arrows, or other keys. You can check Fl::event_key() to figure out why
it moved. For navigation it will be the key pressed and for interaction
with the window manager it will be zero.

\subsection events_fl_unfocus FL_UNFOCUS

This event is sent to the previous Fl::focus() widget when another
widget gets the focus or the window loses focus.

\section events_keyboard Keyboard Events

\subsection events_fl_keydown FL_KEYBOARD, FL_KEYDOWN, FL_KEYUP

A key was pressed (FL_KEYDOWN) or released (FL_KEYUP). FL_KEYBOARD
is a synonym for FL_KEYDOWN, and both names are used interchangeably
in this documentation.

The key can be found in Fl::event_key().
The text that the key should insert can be found with Fl::event_text()
and its length is in Fl::event_length().

If you use the key, then \p handle() should return 1. If you
return zero then FLTK assumes you ignored the key and will
then attempt to send it to a parent widget. If none of them want
it, it will change the event into a \p FL_SHORTCUT event.
FL_KEYBOARD events are also generated by the character palette/map.

To receive \p FL_KEYBOARD events you must also respond to the
\p FL_FOCUS and \p FL_UNFOCUS events by returning 1. This way
FLTK knows whether to bother sending your widget keyboard events.
(Some widgets don't need them, e.g. Fl_Box.)

If you are writing a text-editing widget you may also want to call the
Fl::compose()
function to translate individual keystrokes into characters.

\p FL_KEYUP events are sent to the widget that
currently has focus. This is not necessarily the same widget
that received the corresponding \p FL_KEYDOWN event
because focus may have changed between events.

\todo Add details on how to detect repeating keys, since on some X servers a repeating key will generate both FL_KEYUP and FL_KEYDOWN, such that to tell if a key is held, you need Fl::event_key(int) to detect if the key is being held down during FL_KEYUP or not.

\subsection events_fl_shortcut FL_SHORTCUT

If the Fl::focus() widget is zero or ignores an \p FL_KEYBOARD event
then FLTK tries sending this event to every widget it can, until one
of them returns non-zero. \p FL_SHORTCUT is first sent to
the Fl::belowmouse() widget, then its parents and
siblings, and eventually to every widget in the window, trying
to find an object that returns non-zero. FLTK tries really hard
to not to ignore any keystrokes!

You can also make "global" shortcuts by using Fl::add_handler().
A global shortcut will work no matter what windows are displayed
or which one has the focus.

\section events_widget Widget Events

\subsection events_fl_deactivate FL_DEACTIVATE

This widget is no longer active, due to
\ref Fl_Widget::deactivate() "deactivate()"
being called on it or one of its parents.
Please note that although
\ref Fl_Widget::active() "active()"
may still return true for this widget after receiving this event,
it is only truly active if
\ref Fl_Widget::active() "active()"
is true for both it and all of its parents.
(You can use
\ref Fl_Widget::active_r() "active_r()"
to check this).

\subsection events_fl_activate FL_ACTIVATE

This widget is now active, due to
\ref Fl_Widget::activate() "activate()"
being called on it or one of its parents.

\subsection events_fl_hide FL_HIDE

This widget is no longer visible, due to
\ref Fl_Widget::hide() "hide()"
being called on it or one of its parents, or due to a parent window
being minimized.
Please note that although
\ref Fl_Widget::visible() "visible()"
may still return true for this widget after receiving this event,
it is only truly visible if
\ref Fl_Widget::visible() "visible()"
is true for both it and all of its parents.
(You can use
\ref Fl_Widget::visible_r() "visible_r()"
to check this).

\subsection events_fl_show FL_SHOW

This widget is visible again, due to
\ref Fl_Widget::show() "show()"
being called on it or one of its parents, or due to a parent window
being restored. <I>A child Fl_Window will respond to this by
actually creating the window if not done already, so if you
subclass a window, be sure to pass \p FL_SHOW to the base
class
\p handle()
method!</I>

\note   The events in this chapter ("Widget Events"), i.e.
        FL_ACTIVATE, FL_DEACTIVATE, FL_SHOW, and FL_HIDE,
        are the only events deactivated and invisible widgets
        can usually get, depending on their states. Under certain
        circumstances, there may also be FL_LEAVE or FL_UNFOCUS
        events delivered to deactivated or hidden widgets.

\section events_clipboard Clipboard Events

\subsection events_fl_paste FL_PASTE

You should get this event some time after you call Fl::paste().
The contents of Fl::event_text() is the text to insert and the
number of characters is in Fl::event_length().

\subsection events_fl_selectionclear FL_SELECTIONCLEAR

The Fl::selection_owner()
will get this event before the selection is moved to another
widget. This indicates that some other widget or program has
claimed the selection. Motif programs used this to clear the
selection indication. Most modern programs ignore this.

\section events_dnd Drag and Drop Events

FLTK supports drag and drop of text and files from any
application on the desktop to an FLTK widget. Text is transferred
using UTF-8 encoding.

See Fl::dnd() for drag and drop from an FLTK widget.

The drag and drop data is available in Fl::event_text()
at the concluding \p FL_PASTE. On some platforms, the
event text is also available for the \p FL_DND_* events,
however application must not depend on that behavior because it
depends on the protocol used on each platform.

\p FL_DND_* events cannot be used in widgets derived
from Fl_Group or Fl_Window.

\subsection events_fl_dnd_files Dropped filenames
Files are received as a list of full path and file names.
- On some X11 platforms, files are received as a URL-encoded UTF-8 string,
that is, non-ASCII bytes (and a few others such as space and %) are
replaced by the 3 bytes "%XY" where XY are the byte's hexadecimal value.
The \ref fl_decode_uri() function can be used to transform in-place
the received string into a proper UTF-8 string. On these platforms,
strings corresponding to dropped files are further prepended
by <tt>file://</tt> (or other prefixes such as <tt>computer://</tt>).
- Other X11 situations put all dropped filenames in a single line, separated by
spaces.
- On non-X11 platforms, including Wayland, files dropped are received one
pathname per line, with no  <tt>'\\n'</tt> after the last pathname.

\subsection events_fl_dnd_enter FL_DND_ENTER

The mouse has been moved to point at this widget. A widget that is
interested in receiving drag'n'drop data must return 1 to receive
\p FL_DND_DRAG, \p FL_DND_LEAVE and \p FL_DND_RELEASE events.

\subsection events_fl_dnd_drag FL_DND_DRAG

The mouse has been moved inside a widget while dragging data.
A widget that is interested in receiving drag'n'drop data should
indicate the possible drop position.

\subsection events_fl_dnd_leave FL_DND_LEAVE

The mouse has moved out of the widget.

\subsection events_fl_dnd_release FL_DND_RELEASE

The user has released the mouse button dropping data into
the widget. If the widget returns 1, it will receive the data in
the immediately following \p FL_PASTE event.

\section events_fl_misc Other events

\subsection events_fl_screen_config FL_SCREEN_CONFIGURATION_CHANGED
Sent whenever the screen configuration changes (a screen is added/removed,
a screen resolution is changed, screens are moved).
Use Fl::add_handler() to be notified of this event.

\subsection events_fl_fullscreen FL_FULLSCREEN

The application window has been changed from normal to fullscreen, or
from fullscreen to normal. If you are using a X window manager which
supports Extended Window Manager Hints, this event will not be
delivered until the change has actually happened.


\section events_event_xxx Fl::event_*() methods

FLTK keeps the information about the most recent event in
static storage. This information is good until the next event is
processed. Thus it is valid inside
\p handle()
and
\p callback()
methods.

These are all trivial inline functions and thus very fast and small:

\li Fl::event_button()
\li Fl::event_clicks()
\li Fl::event_dx()
\li Fl::event_dy()
\li Fl::event_inside()
\li Fl::event_is_click()
\li Fl::event_key()
\li Fl::event_length()
\li Fl::event_state()
\li Fl::event_text()
\li Fl::event_x()
\li Fl::event_x_root()
\li Fl::event_y()
\li Fl::event_y_root()
\li Fl::get_key()
\li Fl::get_mouse()
\li Fl::test_shortcut()

\section events_propagation Event Propagation

Widgets receive events via the virtual handle() function. The argument indicates
the type of event that can be handled. The widget must indicate if it handled the
event by returning 1. FLTK will then remove the event and wait for further events
from the host. If the widget's handle function returns 0, FLTK may redistribute
the event based on a few rules.

Most events are sent directly to the \p handle() method
of the Fl_Window that the window system says they
belong to.  The window (actually the Fl_Group that
Fl_Window is a subclass of) is responsible for sending
the events on to any child widgets.  To make the
Fl_Group code somewhat easier, FLTK sends some events
(\p FL_DRAG, \p FL_RELEASE, \p FL_KEYBOARD,
\p FL_SHORTCUT, \p FL_UNFOCUS, and \p FL_LEAVE)
directly to leaf widgets. These procedures
control those leaf widgets:

\li Fl::add_handler()
\li Fl::belowmouse()
\li Fl::focus()
\li Fl::grab()
\li Fl::modal()
\li Fl::pushed()
\li Fl::release() (deprecated, see Fl::grab(0))
\li Fl_Widget::take_focus()

FLTK propagates events along the widget hierarchy depending on the kind of event
and the status of the UI. Some events are injected directly into the widgets,
others may be resent as new events to a different group of receivers.

Mouse click events are first sent to the window that caused them. The window
then forwards the event down the hierarchy until it reaches the widget that
is below the click position. If that widget uses the given event, the widget
is marked "pushed" and will receive all following mouse motion (FL_DRAG) events
until the mouse button is released.

Mouse motion (FL_MOVE) events are sent to the Fl::belowmouse() widget, i.e.
the widget that returned 1 on the last FL_ENTER event.

Mouse wheel events are sent to the window that caused the event. The window
propagates the event down the tree, first to the widget that is below the
mouse pointer, and if that does not succeed, to all other widgets in the group.
This ensures that scroll widgets work as expected with the widget furthest
down in the hierarchy getting the first opportunity to use the wheel event,
but also giving scroll bars, that are not directly below the mouse a chance.

Keyboard events are sent directly to the widget that has keyboard focus.
If the focused widget rejects the event, it is resent as a shortcut event,
first to the top-most window, then to the widget below the mouse pointer,
propagating up the hierarchy to all its parents. Those send the event also
to all widgets that are not below the mouse pointer. Now if that did not work
out, the shortcut is sent to all registered shortcut handlers.

If we are still unsuccessful, the event handler flips the case of the shortcut
letter and starts over. Finally, if the key is "escape", FLTK sends a close
event to the top-most window.

All other events are pretty much sent right away to the window that created
the event.

Widgets can "grab" events. The grabbing window gets all events exclusively, but
usually by the same rules as described above.

Windows can also request exclusivity in event handling by making the
window modal.


\section events_compose_characters FLTK Compose-Character Sequences

The character composition done by Fl_Input widget
requires that you call the Fl::compose() function if you are
writing your own text editor widget.

Currently, all characters made by single key strokes
with or without modifier keys, or by system-defined character
compose sequences (that can involve dead keys or a compose key) can be input.
You should call Fl::compose() in case any
enhancements to this processing are done in the future. The
interface has been designed to handle arbitrary UTF-8 encoded
text.

The following methods are provided for character composition:

\li Fl::compose()
\li Fl::compose_reset()

Under Mac OS X, FLTK "previews" partially composed sequences.
