\section faq_start Where do I start learning FLTK?

It is assumed you know C++, which is the language all FLTK programs
are written in, including FLTK itself.

If you like reading manuals to work your way into things, a good start
is the FLTK documentation's \ref intro. Under the \ref basics section
there's an example 'hello world' program that includes a line-by-line
description.

If you like looking at simple code first to pique your interest, and then
read up from there, start with the example programs in the test/ and examples/
directory that is included with the source code. A good place to start is
the 'hello world' program in test/hello.cxx. Also do a google search for
"FLTK example programs". "Erco's Cheat Page" is one that shows many simple
examples of how to do specific things.

If you like to run example programs and look for ones that are like yours
and then read them, download and build FLTK from the source, then run the
test/demo program. Also, go into the 'examples/' directory and run 'make',
then run some of those programs.

If you prefer watching TV to reading books and code, google search for 
"FLTK video tutorials" which has some introductory examples of how to
write FLTK programs in C++ and build them.

\section faq_box_with_text How do I make a box with text?

The 'hello world' program shows how to make a box with text.
All widgets have labels, so picking a simple widget like Fl_Box
and setting its label() and using align() to align the label
and labelfont() to set the font, and labelsize() to set the size,
you can get text just how you want.

Labels are not selectable though; if you want selectable text,
you can use Fl_Output or Fl_Multiline_Output for simple text
that doesn't include scrollbars. For more complex text that
might want scrollbars and multiple colors/fonts, use either
Fl_Text_Display which handles plain text, or Fl_Help_View
which handles simple HTML formatted text.

\section faq_license Can I use FLTK to make closed-source commercial applications?

Yes. The FLTK \ref license is standard LGPL, but also includes a special
clause ("exception") to allow for static linking. Specifically:

\verbatim

    [from the top of the FLTK LGPL License section on exceptions]

    3. Static linking of applications and widgets to the FLTK library does
    not constitute a derivative work and does not require the author to
    provide source code for the application or widget, use the shared FLTK
    libraries, or link their applications or widgets against a user-supplied
    version of FLTK.

    If you link the application or widget to a modified version of FLTK,
    then the changes to FLTK must be provided under the terms of the LGPL
    in sections 1, 2, and 4.

    4. You do not have to provide a copy of the FLTK license with programs
    that are linked to the FLTK library, nor do you have to identify the
    FLTK license in your program or documentation as required by section 6
    of the LGPL.

    However, programs must still identify their use of FLTK.  The following
    example statement can be included in user documentation to satisfy
    this requirement:

	[program/widget] is based in part on the work of the 
	FLTK project (http://www.fltk.org).

\endverbatim

\section faq_escape Hitting the 'Escape' key closes windows - how do I prevent this?

[From FLTK article #378]

1. FLTK has a "global event handler" that makes Escape try to close the
window, the same as clicking the close box.  To disable this everywhere
you can install your own that pretends it wants the escape key and thus
stops the default one from seeing it (this may not be what you want,
see below about the callbacks):

\code
static int my_handler(int event) {
  if (event == FL_SHORTCUT) return 1; // eat all shortcut keys
  return 0;
}
...in main():
  Fl::add_handler(my_handler);
...
\endcode

2. Attempts to close a window (both clicking the close box or typing
Escape) call that window's callback.  The default version of the callback
does hide().  To make the window not close or otherwise do something
different you replace the callback.  To make the main window exit the
program:

\code
void my_callback(Fl_Widget*, void*) {
  exit(0);
}
...
  main_window->callback(my_callback);
...
\endcode

If you don't want Escape to close the main window and exit you can check
for and ignore it.  This is better than replacing the global handler
because Escape will still close pop-up windows:

\code
void my_callback(Fl_Widget*, void*) {
  if (Fl::event()==FL_SHORTCUT && Fl::event_key()==FL_Escape) 
    return; // ignore Escape
  exit(0);
}
\endcode

It is very common to ask for confirmation before exiting, this can be
done with:

\code
void my_callback(Fl_Widget*, void*) {
  if (fl_ask("Are you sure you want to quit?"))
    exit(0);
}
\endcode
