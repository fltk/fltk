 \sa \ref FL/Enumerations.H.

This appendix lists the enumerations provided in the
<FL/Enumerations.H> header file, organized by section.
Constants whose value are zero are marked with "(0)",
this is often useful to know when programming.


\section enumerations_versions Version Numbers

The FLTK version number is stored in a number of compile-time constants:

  - FL_MAJOR_VERSION - The major release number, currently  1
  - FL_MINOR_VERSION - The minor release number, currently  4
  - FL_PATCH_VERSION - The patch release number, currently  0
  - FL_VERSION - \b [Deprecated] A combined floating-point version number for
      the major, minor, and patch release numbers, currently 1.0400
  - FL_API_VERSION - A combined integer version number for the major, minor,
      and patch release numbers, currently 10400 (use this instead of
      FL_VERSION, if possible)
  - FL_ABI_VERSION - A combined integer version number for the application
      binary interface (ABI) major, minor, and patch release numbers,
      currently 10400 (default)

  \note The ABI version (FL_ABI_VERSION) is usually constant throughout one
        major/minor release version, for instance 10300 if FL_API_VERSION is 10304.
        Hence the ABI is constant if only the patch version is changed.
        You can change this with configure or CMake though if you want the
        latest enhancements (called "ABI features", see CHANGES).
