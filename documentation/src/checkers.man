.SH SYNOPSIS
\fICheckers\fR is a FLTK-based version of the game of checkers.
The game is played on an 8x8 board with each player starting with
12 pieces or "checkers" on opposite sides of the board. The
computer plays the white checkers in this version of the game.
.LP
The object of the game is to remove all of your opponents pieces.
Players move one of their pieces diagonally forward on each move,
either a single space or by "jumping" an adjacent piece. Your
opponents pieces are removed by jumping them - you can make
multiple jumps in a single turn.
.LP
If a piece reaches the other side of the board, it is converted
to a "king" which can move both forwards and backwards.
