applications created using FLTK, both as an administrator and as
a regular user.

\section fltk-options_basics Runtime Options

FLTK keeps track of various aspects of the user interface in a system-wide
database. Users have the ability to set their own preferences and override
default or system settings. For instance, FLTK will display a dotted
rectangle around the widget with current focus. This might not be desirable
for users who do not use keyboard navigation and do not need the rectangle.
This can be turned off by setting the OPTION_VISIBLE_FOCUS option to 'off'
for that user, which will disable the focus rectangle in all FLTK-based
applications.

\section fltk-options_access Obtaining Current Settings

Options are kept in preference files using the signature
`Fl_Preferences::CORE_SYSTEM, "fltk.org", "fltk"` for system-wide settings
and `Fl_Preferences::CORE_USER, "fltk.org", "fltk"` for individual users.
They can be accessed by using the function `bool Fl::option(Fl_Option opt)`.
If an application needs to temporarily override user or system settings,
it can use the function `void option(Fl_Option opt, bool val)`.

To make changes to options permanently, FLTK provides an administrative
tool called fltk-options.

\section fltk-options_app Administrative Tool

`fltk-options` is a hybrid app that is part of FLTK and can be installed on
the target system. It includes an up-to-date man page.

When fltk-options is called without any command-line arguments, it opens in
interactive mode and provides a user interface to view and alter all
system and current user options.

Starting the tool from a shell, the command-line options `-S` and `-U` can be
used to display or change system or user options. On MS-Windows, `fltk-options`
is also available as `fltk-options-cmd.exe`.

\section fltk-options_options List of Options

Calling `fltk-options --help` gives a list of all available commands, and
options and their values. `fltk-options --help OPTION` prints more detailed
information for OPTION if available. In interactive mode, tooltips provide
this additional information.

A full list of options can be found in the manual at Fl::Fl_Option.
