<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT><A NAME=intro>1 - Introduction to FLTK</A></H1>
 The Fast Light Tool Kit (&quot;FLTK&quot;, pronounced &quot;fulltick&quot;) is a LGPL'd 
C++ graphical user interface toolkit for X (UNIX&reg;), OpenGL&reg;, and 
Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; NT 4.0, 95, or 98. It was originally developed by 
Mr. Bill Spitzak and is currently maintained by a small group of 
developers across the world with a central repository in the US. 
<H2>History of FLTK</H2>
 It has always been Bill's belief that the GUI API of all modern 
systems is much too high level.  Toolkits (even FL) are <I>not</I> what 
should be provided and documented as part of an operating system.  The 
system only has to provide arbitrary shaped but featureless windows, a 
powerful set of graphics drawing calls, and a simple <I>unalterable</I>
 method of delivering events to the owners of the windows.  NeXT (if 
you ignored NextStep) provided this, but they chose to hide it and 
tried to push their own baroque toolkit instead... 
<P>Many of the ideas in FLTK were developed on a NeXT (but <I>not</I>
 using NextStep) in 1987 in a C toolkit Bill called &quot;views&quot;.  Here he 
came up with passing events downward in the tree and having the handle 
routine return a value indicating the used the event, and the 
table-driven menus.  In general he was trying to prove that complex UI 
ideas could be entirely implemented in a user space toolkit, with no 
knowledge or support by the system. </P>
<P>After going to film school for a few years, Bill worked at Sun 
Microsystems on the (doomed) NeWS project.  Here he found an even 
better and cleaner windowing system, and he reimplemented &quot;views&quot; atop 
that.  NeWS did have an unnecessarily complex method of delivering 
events which hurt it.  But the designers did admit that perhaps the 
user could write just as good of a button as they could, and officially 
exposed the lower level interface. </P>
<P>With the death of NeWS Bill realized that he would have to live with 
X.  The biggest problem with X is the &quot;window manager&quot;, which means 
that the toolkit can no longer control the window borders or drag the 
window around. </P>
<P>At Digital Domain Bill discovered another toolkit, &quot;Forms&quot;.  Forms 
was similar to his work, but provided many more widgets, since it was 
used in many real applications, rather then as theoretical work.  He 
decided to use Forms, except he integrated his table-driven menus into 
it. Several very large programs were created using this version of 
Forms. </P>
<P>The need to switch to OpenGL and GLX, portability, and a desire to 
use C++ subclassing required a rewrite of Forms.  This produced the 
first version of FLTK.  The conversion to C++ required so many changes 
it made it impossible to recompile any Forms objects.  Since it was 
incompatible anyway, Bill decided to incorporate his older ideas as 
much as possible by simplifying the lower level interface and the event 
passing mechanisim. </P>
<P>Bill received permission to release it for free on the Internet, 
with the GNU general public license.  Response from Internet users 
indicated that the Linux market dwarfed the SGI and high-speed GL 
market, so he rewrote it to use X for all drawing, greatly speeding it 
up on these machines.  That is the version you have now. </P>
<P>Digital Domain has since withdrawn support for FLTK.  While Bill is 
no longer able to actively develop it, he still contributes to FLTK in 
his free time and is a part of the FLTK development team. </P>
<H2>Features</H2>
 FLTK was designed to be statically linked. This was done by splitting 
it into many small objects and desigining it so that functions that are 
not used do not have pointers to them in the parts that are used, and 
thus do not get linked in. This allows you to make an easy-to-install 
program, or to modify FLTK to the exact requirements of your 
application, without worrying about bloat. FLTK works fine as a shared 
library, though, and has started being included on Linux distributions. 
<P>Here are some of the core features unique to FLTK: </P>
<UL>
<LI>sizeof(Fl_Widget) == 40 to 48.</LI>
<LI>The &quot;core&quot; (the &quot;hello&quot; program compiled &amp; linked with a static 
FLTK  library using gcc on a 486 and then stripped) is 39.5K.</LI>
<LI>A program including every widget is less than 108K.  Does not use 
 macros, templates, multiple inheritance, or exceptions.</LI>
<LI>Written directly atop Xlib (or WIN32) for maximum speed,  and 
carefully optimized for code size and performance.</LI>
<LI>Precise low-level compatability between the X11 and WIN32  version 
(only about 10% of the code is different).</LI>
<LI>Interactive user interface builder program. Output is 
 human-readable and editable C++ source code.</LI>
<LI>Support for the X11 double buffering extension (emulation  if not 
available and under Windows.)</LI>
<LI>Support for X11 overlay hardware (emulation if none and  under 
WIN32.)</LI>
<LI>Very small &amp; fast portable 2-D drawing library to hide  Xlib and 
WIN32.</LI>
<LI>OpenGL/Mesa drawing area widget.</LI>
<LI>Support for OpenGL overlay hardware on both X11 and WIN32. 
 Emulation if none.</LI>
<LI>Text input fields with Emacs key bindings, X cut &amp;  paste, and 
foreign letter compose!</LI>
<LI>Compatibility header file for the GLUT library.</LI>
<LI>Compatibility header file for the XForms library.</LI>
<LI>Much too much to list here...</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Licensing</H2>
 FLTK comes with complete free source code. FLTK is available under the 
terms of the <A href=#licensing>GNU Library General Public License</A>. 
Contrary to popular belief, it can be used in commercial software! 
(Even Bill Gates could use it.) 
<H2>What Does &quot;FLTK&quot; Mean?</H2>
 FLTK was originally designed to be compatable with the Forms Library 
written for SGI machines. In that library all the functions and 
structures started with &quot;fl_&quot;. This naming was extended to all new 
methods and widgets in the C++ library, and this prefix was taken as 
the name of the library. It is almost impossible to search for &quot;FL&quot; on 
the Internet, due to the fact that it is also the abbreviation for 
Florida. After much debating and searching for a new name for the 
toolkit, which was already in use by several people, Bill came up with 
&quot;FLTK&quot;, and even a bogus excuse that it stands for &quot;The Fast Light Tool 
Kit&quot;. 
<H2>Building and Installing FLTK Under UNIX</H2>
 In most cases you can just type &quot;make&quot;.  This will run configure with 
the default of no options and then compile everything. 
<P>FLTK uses GNU autoconf to configure itself for your UNIX platform. 
The main things that the configure script will look for are the X11, 
OpenGL (or Mesa), and JPEG header and library files.  Make sure that 
they are in the standard include/library locations. </P>
<P>You can run configure yourself to get the exact setup you need. Type 
&quot;./configure &lt;options&gt;&quot;, where options are: </P>
<DL>
<DT>--enable-debug</DT>
<DD>Enable debugging code &amp; symbols</DD>
<DT>--enable-shared</DT>
<DD>Enable generation of shared libraries</DD>
<DT>--bindir=/path</DT>
<DD>Set the location for executables [default = /usr/local/bin]</DD>
<DT>--libdir=/path</DT>
<DD>Set the location for libraries [default = /usr/local/lib]</DD>
<DT>--includedir=/path</DT>
<DD>Set the location for include files. [default = /usr/local/include]</DD>
<DT>--prefix=/dir</DT>
<DD>Set the directory prefix for files [default = /usr/local]</DD>
</DL>
 When the configure script is done you can just run the &quot;make&quot; command. 
This will build the library, FLUID tool, and all of the test programs. 
<P>To install the library, become root and type &quot;make install&quot;.  This 
will copy the &quot;fluid&quot; executable to &quot;bindir&quot;, the header files to 
&quot;includedir&quot;, and the library files to &quot;libdir&quot;. </P>
<H2>Building FLTK Under Micrsoft Windows</H2>
 There are two ways to build FLTK under Microsoft Windows.  The first 
is to use the Visual C++ 5.0 project files under the &quot;visualc&quot; 
directory.  Just open (or double-click on) the &quot;fltk.dsw&quot; file to get 
the whole shebang. 
<P>The second method is to use a GNU-based development tool with the 
files in the &quot;makefiles&quot; directory.  To build using one of these tools 
simply copy the appropriate makeinclude and config files to the main 
directory and do a make: </P>
<UL>
<PRE>
cp makefiles/makeinclude.&lt;env&gt; makeinclude
cp makefiles/config.&lt;env&gt; config.h
make
</PRE>
</UL>
<H2>Building FLTK Under OS/2</H2>
 The current OS/2 build requires XFree86 for OS/2 to work.  A native 
Presentation Manager version has not been implemented yet (volunteers 
are welcome!). 
<P>To build the XFree86 version of FLTK for OS/2, copy the appropriate 
makeinclude and config files to the main directory and do a make: </P>
<UL>
<PRE>
cp makefiles/Makefile.os2x Makefile
cp makefiles/makeinclude.os2x makeinclude
cp makefiles/config.os2x config.h
make
</PRE>
</UL>
