Changes in FLTK 1.0, up to FLTK 1.0.11 (May 7, 2001)

CHANGES IN FLTK 1.0.11

	- CHANGED THE DEFAULT RUN-TIME LINKING TO "MULTITHREADED
	  DLL". You'll need to change your project settings to
	  use this as well or you'll get errors.

	- Added new --disable-gl option to configure script.

	- Added new const const pointer versions of pixmap
	  functions to eliminate an annoying pointer warning
	  message that was generated by the Sun and other C++
	  compilers.

	- Eliminated all "var hides class::var" warnings.

	- Eliminated all "string literal converted to char *"
	  warnings.

	- OS/2 updates from Alexander Mai.

	- Tidied up the HTML documentation to be more standards
	  compliant.

	- Compiling with -DBOXX_BUGS will work around some
	  problems with the newest X drivers that BoXX delivers,
	  the problems all affect use of Overlays for normal X
	  drawing and OpenGL drawing. Normal compilation is
	  unchanged.

	- The file chooser buttons use user_data() rather than
	  the label to decide what to do, allowing the label to
	  be somewhat cleaner.

	- Selection color on X changed to blue, to match what
	  happens on Windows now.

	- Added support for AIX (static library only).

	- Added support for SunOS 4.x

	- Now process WIN32 WM_ACTIVATEAPP message to reset the
	  key and button states in Fl::e_state.

	- Fl_has_idle only tested N-1 callbacks and missed one.

	- Restored WM_SYNCPAINT handling under WIN32; this fixed
	  a refresh bug under some versions of Windows.

	- Check for OpenGL headers before checking to see if
	  OpenGL is supported.  This should eliminate compile
	  errors due to missing non-FLTK header files...

	- Add -D_INCLUDE_POSIX_SOURCE option when compiling with
	  the HP compilers.

	- Replaced remaining _WIN32 symbols with WIN32

	- Removed reference to unused GL/glu.h header file, which is missing on
	  some Linux systems.

	- Fl_Gl_Window has a new method to allow you to get and set the context:

	      void Fl_Gl_Window::context(void*, int destroy = 0)
	      void* Fl_Gl_Window::context() const;

	  Return or set a pointer to the GLContext that this window is
	  using. This is a system-dependent structure, but it is portable to
	  copy the context from one window to another. You can also set it to
	  NULL, which will force FLTK to recreate the context the next time
	  make_current() is called, this is useful for getting around bugs in
	  OpenGL implementations.

	  If destroy_flag is true the context will be destroyed by fltk when
	  the window is destroyed, or when the mode() is changed, or the next
	  time context(x) is called.

	- Some cleanup of Fl_Gl_Choice to move most of the system dependent
	  #ifdefs into Fl_Gl_Choice.cxx.

	- Fl_Gl_Window does not set drawbuffer(BACKBUFFER) for
	  single-buffered windows.

	- Fl_Input::replace(...) correctly updates the display
	  if the replaced region does not include the mark,
	  point, or selected region.

	- Added Fl::add_check(...), Fl::remove_check, and
	  Fl::has_check. These are similar to idle callbacks but
	  are only called just before it waits for new events.
	  They can be used to watch for changes in global state
	  and respond to them.

	- "accu-timer": some changes to repeat_timeout that seem
	  to make it accurate on Unix and WIN32 at speeds up to
	  500000 timeouts/second (and 700000 on Linux), and
	  within about .001% as accurate as the system clock.

	- Fix to Fl_Valuator::step() by Guillermo Andrade.

	- Fixed the FLUID write-menu bug introduced in 1.0.10

	- Fl::flush() now calls GdiFlush() under WIN32 to
	  ensure that all graphics are drawn.

	- fl_curve() now uses a much better algorithim to figure
	  out how many pieces to cut the curve into.

	- FLUID now uses GetTempPath() under WIN32 to determine
	  where to store the clipboard.

	- Right-ctrl does not delete selected text in Fl_Input,
	  until you type a composed character.

	- Added simple FLTK and FLUID manual pages.

	- Fl_Gl_Window leaked memory under WIN32.

	- The colbrowser demo was missing an include file when
	  compiled under OS/2.


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.0.10

	- Added a strcasecmp() function to FLUID; AIX doesn't
	  have it.

	- Bug #115509: Fl_Scroll not repainting background.

	- Updated the configure script and makeinclude.in file
	  to work with the Sun PRO compilers.

	- Disabled the WIN32 async socket select code by default:
	  it doesn't seem to work anymore...

	- Fl::below_mouse() was incorrectly clearing e_is_click;
	  this prevented any double-clicks from getting
	  through...

	- No longer clear Fl::keysym on every event, this makes
	  better back compatability and fixes Win2000

	- FLUID now restores which tab in an Fl_Tabs was
	  selected when loads .fl files.

	- Hack to fix the annoying "raise another application
	  when a modal window is closed" problem on WIN32.

	- Fl_Tabs now draws the background behind the tabs.

	- Fl::set_fonts() on WIN32 fixed to work before the
	  first window is shown.

	- CUA function keys, code submitted by George Yohng
	  <yohng@drivex.dosware.8m.com>

	- Another attempt to get glut.h to work on WIN32.

	- Fl_Menu_::add() ignores '&' signs when comparing menu
	  items, so you don't have to make the shortcuts the
	  same all the time.

	- Fixed bit-flipping patterns in WIN32 bitmap code.

	- Fixed size of data written by gif images to .C files

	- Menu titles and buttons in the menubar can be images
	  (allows it to be used as a toolbar)

	- Reads selectBackground from the xrdb database to set
	  the selection color. Adding this to your .Xdefaults
	  will make fltk and Motif programs look much more
	  Windoze-like:

	      *selectForeground: white
	      *selectBackground: #000080

	- FL_WHEN_RELEASE on Fl_Input will now do the callback
	  when the input field is hidden, for instance when it
	  is on a tab and the user switches to another tab.

	- Fl_Gl_Window with an overlay on X always resized any
	  child windows even if you turned resizable() off
	  because it turned it back on to resize the overlay
	  window. This patch avoids changing resizable().

	- Fix so multiple Fl::add_idle() calls works

	- The input focus got messed up if you called
	  Fl_Tabs::value(x) and there was something that took
	  focus on an earlier tab.

	- Removed some (not all) of the warnings when compiled
	  with -Wwrite-strings, this should also get similar
	  warnings Solaris produces.

	- Made Fl_Browser not hide the Fl_Widget::show() method

	- Changes & additions for OS/2 from Alexander Mai

	- Patch from Mike Lindner to make the turning on/off of
	  scrollbars on Fl_Scroll smarter.

	- Added missing FL_EXPORT for Fl_Valuator::format()

	- Shortcuts for "buttons" in a Fl_Menu_Bar work again.

	- Fix for cut/paste support and Xdnd.

	- Shortcuts for submenu titles in a menubar pop up the
	  submenu (rather than calling the callback)

	- Added documentation for GL_SWAP_TYPE

	- Buttons with box(FL_NO_BOX) did not draw.  Apparently
	  they did in older versions of fltk, I restored this.
	  (bug 108771)

	- Removed 8-bit colormap drawing code that was not doing
	  anything in fl_draw_image due to the colormap
	  allocation changes.  I also made fl_color(r,g,b)
	  actually allocate the requested color rather than the
	  nearest fltk color-cube color (this is only done for
	  the first color that maps to a given entry in the fltk
	  color cube), the result is that pixmaps with a small
	  number of colors are drawn much more accurately. The
	  resulting code seems to produce better images and is a
	  good deal smaller!

	- Fixed makeinclude.in so CFLAGS are used for c source
	  code instead of CXXFLAGS. (bug 108694)

	- Better fix for gif files suggested by pauly (bug
	  108770)

	- Performance of Fl_Gl_Window may be improved on some
	  types of OpenGL implementations, in particular MESA
	  or other software emulators, by setting the
	  GL_SWAP_TYPE environment variable.  This variable
	  declares what is in the back buffer after you do a
	  swapbuffers:

	      setenv GL_SWAP_TYPE COPY

	      This indicates that the back buffer is copied to
	      the front buffer, and still contains it's old
	      data. This is true of many hardware
	      implementations.  Setting this will speed up
	      emulation of overlays, and widgets that can do
	      partial update can take advantage of this as
	      damage() will not be cleared to -1.

	      setenv GL_SWAP_TYPE NODAMAGE

	      This indicates that nothing changes the back
	      buffer except drawing into it.  This is true of
	      MESA and Win32 software emulation and perhaps some
	      hardware emulation on systems with lots of memory.

	  All other values for GL_SWAP_TYPE, and not setting
	  the variable, cause fltk to assumme that the back
	  buffer must be completely redrawn after a swap.

	  This is easily tested by running the gl_overlay demo
	  program and seeing if the display is correct when
	  you drag another window over it or if you drag the
	  window off the screen and back on. You have to exit
	  and run the program again for it to see any changes
	  to the environment variable.

	- Optimized colormap usage on 8-bit displays with
	  images. New code only allocates colors as they are
	  needed (still converts indexed images to full RGB and
	  dithers, tho...)

	- Fixed .gif files in FLUID, they were broken by the fix
	  for large .xpm files in version 1.0.9.

	- Fix for OpenGL hardware overlays with the transparent
	  index != 0. Tested on the brand new HP Linux
	  Workstations, this is the only bug encountered.  Both
	  X and OpenGL hardware overlay works perfectly on
	  these, though configue may not enable it by
	  default...)

	- Fl_Choice and all other Fl_Menu_ subclasses draw the
	  items using textcolor() as the default color of the
	  text.

	- Fix suggested by Stuart Levy to fix scrolling when
	  deleting items from the browser.

	- Replaced the -$(MAKEFLAGS) with $(MFLAGS) as per the
	  gmake documenation.  Apperntly this works with other
	  make programs and MAKEFLAGS is passed invisibly by
	  gmake, though the documenation is not too clear...


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.0.9

	- More documentation fixes.
	- GLUT_STROKE_*_ROMAN in glut.h are defined as 0,1 on
	  WIN32 to match the glut header files there.
	- Added Fl::has_timeout() and Fl::has_idle() functions.
	- Added new Fl::repeat_timeout() method that
	  measures time from when the last timeout was called.
	  This has slightly less overhead and allows accurate
	  spacing of timeouts.
	- More Cygwin changes
	- FLUID could crash with identifiers with trailing
	  whitespace.
	- Fixed the XPM loading code in FLUID to handle files
	  longer than 2048 lines.
	- Added a bunch of missing FL_EXTERN's to glut.h to
	  eliminate GLUT linking errors under WIN32.
	- Fix for sliders so that clicking on one with a small
	  (or zero) slider_size will not move the slider.
	- fl_shortcut.cxx didn't export fl_old_shortcut() in the
	  WIN32 DLL.
	- Fixed xpaint link in the documentation.
	- Included Fl_Input word-wrap fixes from Alexander Rabi
	  Beels. This will not affect things much because
	  word-wrap is normally disabled.
	- Patch from Stuart Levy so the *last* widget in an
	  Fl_Pack may be resizable.  This should be compatable
	  because resizable didn't do anything before so there
	  was no reason to set it.
	- Cleaned up the timeout and Fl::wait() code.  The new
	  code calls the clock function less than half as much,
	  which results in a noticable performance improvement
	  in some apps.
	- Fl::wait(time) with a time greater than the system can
	  handle (24.855 days on NT, the same on some Unix
	  systems) will now act as though the time is infinity.
	  Before it would do unpredictable things.
	- "USE_POLL" now compiles and works, although it is
	  disabled by default. poll() is an alternative to the
	  UNIX select() call which is available on some version
	  of UNIX and may be faster depending on the platform;
	  try it by editing config.h.
	- The WIN32 USE_ASYNC_SELECT code now does translation
	  and dispatching of the select events; this makes
	  Windows a lot happier.
	- Added a check for an open display in Fl::wait() so
	  that you don't need an open window under X to call it.

	  [changes in snapshot 2]

	- fl_old_shortcut() wasn't being exported in the WIN32 DLL
	  project.
	- Updated Cygwin and Mingw makefiles.
	- Updated the BC++ project file.
	- You can no longer insert control chars into Fl_Int/Float_Input.
	- Fl_Multiline_Input now resets the horizontal position when
	  focus is changed; this caused problems when multiple multiline
	  widgets were used in an application.
	- All handle() methods are now public, and all draw() methods are
	  now protected in FLTK widgets.
	- More fixes to the OpenGL overlay code on win32.  This now
	  seems to work quite reliably on several different pieces of
	  hardware. Apparently doing SetLayerPaletteEntries with a
	  palette larger than the overlay size caused the drivers to
	  screw up in unpredictable ways. Also SwapBuffers swapped both
	  the overlay and main window, which is not what fltk's
	  interface wanted, this was easy to fix however.
	- Patch for full scrollbars so that clicking on them does not
	  move anything.
	- Documentation fixes.
	- Better horizontal scrolling of Fl_Input when cursor is near
	  the end of the line.
	- Fl_Input::value(x) selects all text.
	- Fl_Output and Fl_Multiline_Output would scroll to the end
	  of the text.
	- filename_isdir() now drops any trailing slash from the
	  filename (needed for Windows)
	- Added return type for main() function in line_style demo.
	- Running FLUID with the "-cs" option writes the I18N message
	  file.
	- The WIN32 version of XParseGeometry() didn't initialize some
	  variables.  This caused a compiler warning but did not affect
	  the actual code.

	  [changes in snapshot 1]

	- EMail changes - fltk-bugs@easysw.com now officially
	  fltk-bugs@fltk.org.
	- The FLTK DLL project file didn't include fl_compose.cxx
	- Dropped the GCC -fno-rtti option since it caused problems
	  with existing programs.
	- Moved the .fl rules back to the test directory.
	- Fixed some makefile and spec file problems.
	- Fixed hardware overlays.  The problem was the new
	  fl_clipped() code, which tests against the current window
	  size.  The hardware overlay code did not set the current
	  window when drawing the overlay.  I needed hardware overlay
	  for DD's code, I'm not sure if these fixes are good enough to
	  enable this in our general release.  Hardware overlay still
	  only works on SGI Irix.
	- Some patches to turn off the MSVC++ -Oa (assumme no aliasing)
	  optimization flag.  Suprisingly this only broke a few parts
	  of fltk, or at least these are the only ones I found.
	- Does not unmap child windows when the main window is
	  iconized.  This reduces flashing when the window is
	  deiconized.
	- Fl::key() is set to zero by all events except key down/up.
	  This will allow you to reliably test if an event or callback
	  was produced by a keystroke.  Fixes the bug posted about
	  stopping Escape from closing the window.
	- User defined cursors on OpenGL windows slowed down NT a
	  *LOT*.  Some attempts to fix this by turning off the cursor
	  while drawing the window.
	- Filename completion in the file chooser works better on NT.
	  Typing TAB fixes the case of everything you typed to match
	  the shortest name that can be completed.


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.0.8

	- Many documentation changes/fixes/improvements.
	- FLUID didn't save Fl_Double_Window's as
	  double-buffered windows.
	- Fl_Menu_ text color is used if Fl_Menu_Item text color
	  is not set.
	- Added Fl::first_window(window) method to change the
	  "top" window that is used when showing modal windows.
	  By default it is the window the user last
	  clicked/typed in.
	- The Fl_Menu::global() handler now uses the current top
	  window instead of the menu bar for modal stuff.
	- Added fl_line_style() function to set the line style.
	  Note that user-defined line styles ONLY WORK UNDER X11
	  and Windows NT/2000. Windows 95/98 do, however,
	  support the "standard" line styles.
	- Fl::wait() does not return immediately when no windows
	- XForms keyboard shortcuts using hex keycode constants
	  now work.
	- Updated the configure script for *BSD and to turn off
	  exceptions and RTTI in the FLTK library itself (does
	  not affect applications which use these things)
	- FLUID now supports I18N using the POSIX or GNU
	  mechanisms.
	- Fixed definition of glutBitmapWidth to match header
	  file.
	- Does not turn visible() on when a window is iconized()
	  or if a modal window is shown and it's parent is
	  iconized.  This allows the code "while (w->visible()
	  && w->damage()) Fl::check();" to reliably wait for the
	  window to be mapped and drawn the first time.
	- Setting box(FL_NO_BOX) on a button makes it an
	  invisible overlay
	- FL_NORMAL_SIZE is now a global variable so you can
	  change the default text size prior to creating your
	  widgets.
	- Menus now draw properly with a box type of
	  FL_FLAT_BOX.
	- Cygwin fixes to compile in POSIX mode.
	- Fl_Value_Input callback can call value() or
	  destructor.
	- OpenGL overlays now work under Windows NT!
	- Fl_Slider and Fl_Scrollbar could cause a divide by
	  zero.
	- Clicking in an Fl_Input field no longer selects the
	  whole field, it just moves the text cursor.
	- Tru64 UNIX fixes for filename_list()
	- Fl_Browser now draws itself properly when deactivated.
	- FLUID GUIs now use Courier font for all code input.
	- The FLUID OK and Cancel buttons are now all shown in
	  the same order in all windows.
	- Fixes to compile under GCC 2.95.2
	- Fixed the BC5 project files.
	- FL_LEFT_MOUSE and friends are now in
	  <FL/Enumerations.H>
	- Fixes for fake OpenGL overlay code under WIN32.
	- Message windows are now resizeable.
	- On WIN32 non_modal (but not modal) windows have the
	  close and size boxes.
	- Fl_Button and friends didn't honor the
	  FL_WHEN_NOT_CHANGED condition.
	- Disabled XDBE on all platforms.
	- XGetDefault patch from James Roth
	- New fl_open_display(Display *) function to allow FLTK
	  to share a display connection with another toolkit
	  (like Xt, GTK, etc.)
	- Shortcut labels for special keys should now display
	  properly under WIN32.
	- fl_set_fonts() did not reuse fonts.
	- Fixed shortcut problem under WIN32 when the focus
	  window changes.
	- "dead" keys should now work under X11.
	- Fixes to make FLTK compile with GCC 2.95.2
	- FL_SHORTCUT fix for I18N.
	- Fixed cut/paste problems under WIN32
	- FLUID now produces correct code for nested class
	  destructors.
	- Nested windows should now redraw properly under WIN32.
	- "table" is now static in fl_cursor.cxx
	- Fl_Chart used the textcolor() and not the color() for
	  horizontal bar charts.
	- Now set the input hint for TWM and TWM-derived window
	  managers.
	- Now look for TrueColor visual if FLTK is compiled with
	  USE_COLORMAP == 0.
	- Fl_Scrollbar could generate a divide-by-0 error if the
	  min and max values were the same.
	- Fl_Menu_::remove() now removes whole submenus if
	  needed.
	- Scrollbar buttons now draw themselves pushed in as
	  needed.
	- Fixed the gl_overlay demo (and gl overlays in general)
	  when they are faked with no hardware and the window is
	  resized.
	- Selections weren't shown in Fl_Browser widgets when an
	  item used the @B (background) format.
	- Windows can now be resized by the program under X11
	  for more window managers.
	- OS/2 makeinclude updates.
	- Added Fl.H required by an inline function in
	  Fl_Repeat_Button.H
	- Fl_add_idle adds new functions to the end of the queue
	  ring, rather than the start, so they are executed in
	  the order added, and a callback that adds itself does
	  not prevent others from being called.
	- FLUID lets you type in code that starts with '#' for
	  cpp directives.
	- XBell() could be called before the X11 display was
	  opened, causing a segfault.
	- Fixed Fl_Gl_Window::ortho() - Borland C++ doesn't
	  define GLint to "int", but instead to "long"...
	- Fixed Fl_Browser scrollbars within an Fl_Scroll
	  widget.
	- Fl_Output (and non-focused Fl_Input) now scroll in
	  response to position()
	- Fl_Input now does not scroll horizontally if the
	  entire string will fit in the widget.
	- Fl_Scrollbar didn't push the right arrow buttons when
	  you clicked outside the scroller.
	- Now use WSAAsyncSelect() for better socket performance
	  with Fl::add_fd()


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.0.7

	- Fixed Fl_Input_ bug under WIN32 - no longer stop accepting input
	  when one of the "Windows" keys is pressed.
	- Now call TranslateEvent for all events under WIN32.
	- Fixes for OpenBSD and NetBSD
	- The FL_CURSOR_HAND cursor now uses the IDC_HAND cursor instead of
	  IDC_UPARROW under Windows 98 and 2000.
	- Fl_Scrollbar now does a page-up/down when you click outside the
	  scroller.
	- Fl_Window::show(0, NULL) causes core dump
	- Fixed a compile-time error in fl_call_main.c for Borland C++.
	- "fluid -c filename.fl" would try to open an X display if the
	  FLUID file contained an Fl_Browser widget.
	- Fl_Browser now correctly measures items with @C or @B color
	  formatting commands.
	- Fixed a bitmap drawing bug for WIN32 (bit reversal table was wrong)
	- fl_xyz() dialogs now set a title in the title bar.
	- fl_alert() sounds the bell under X11.
	- fl_xyz() dialogs now call MessageBeep() under WIN32.
	- Fl_Browser_ didn't draw the selection box with the inactive color
	  when the browser wasn't activated.
	- Fl_Browser now responds to FL_KEYBOARD as well as FL_SHORTCUT.  If
	  you subclass it to accept focus then keyboard navigation will work.
	- Fl_Tile and Fl_Tabs do their callback when the user changes their
	  display.
	- Made some of the private methods of Fl_Browser protected.
	- Now set win_gravity correctly, this helps some X
	  window managers that use it position the window where
	  FLTK wants it to be.
	- 0-width browsers crashed.
	- Minor change: if the X window manager does not do
	  anything else with windows that don't have their
	  position specified, the windows appear centered in the
	  screen, rather than in the top-left corner.  This
	  happened with modal windows under Irix 4Dwm.  This
	  also causes windows to be centered when no window
	  manager is running, which might be useful for
	  installation gui programs?
	- Clicking in an Fl_Input field the first time selects the entire
	  field.
	- Clicking the middle mouse button in an Fl_Input field now inserts
	  the text at the indicated position instead of the cursor position.
	- Drag-selecting text in an Fl_Input field now copies the text
	  automatically.
	- Fl::flush() no longer calls the draw() method for invisible windows.
	- Calling deactivate() on an invisible widget could cause an
	  infinite loop in some obscure cases.
	- Added #pragma's for SGI C++ compilers - the 6.{23} X headers had
	  errors in them.
	- Fl_Gl_Window::ortho() changed so that text and images
	  are not erased if the origin is off the left/bottom of the
	  window.
	- Small change to Fl_Input so that a click that gives it
	  the focus also selects all the text.
	- Fixed a slider drawing problem.
	- You can now add/delete children of Fl_Tabs widgets whether or
	  not they are visible.
	- Now embed woff options for SGI C++ compilers (gets rid of X11
	  header warnings)
	- draw_pixmap used a cast that the Digital UNIX C++ compiler didn't
	  like.
	- The GLUT function key constants were off by one.
	- The XPM reading code didn't handle RGB colors other than #rrggbb.


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.0.6

    - Fl_win32.cxx defined WM_MOUSE_LEAVE instead of WM_MOUSELEAVE.
    - Fl_get_key_win32.cxx needed to include <ctype.h>
    - gl_draw_pixmap.cxx needed a pointer cast for ANSI C++.
    - Fl_Repeat_Button didn't always delete its timeout.
    - Now keep track of the current OpenGL context; this provides
      significant performance improvements for OpenGL applications
      with a single context.


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.0.5

    - Fl_Roller didn't handle a width and height of 0.
    - filename_list() fix for FreeBSD.
    - Fixed RPM install docos - needed "--install" option...
    - Fl_Browser_ wouldn't draw the vertical scrollbar right away if it
      added a horizontal one which covered the last line.
    - Fl_Tabs problems - single-character labels don't show up (problem in
      measure_tabs() or measure_label() methods?), and doesn't clear top
      tab area before drawing tabs.
    - Fl_Browser needs a destructor.
    - fl_draw_label() quoted characters between 0x80 and 0xa0, which
      caused problems for some programs using the WinANSI character set.
    - FLUID didn't handle declared class destructors.
    - Fixed another WIN32 cut/paste bug.
    - Fl_Tabs didn't work properly when there was only 1 tab.
    - Fl_Menu::add() didn't delete the old array.
    - Fl_Repeat_Button didn't delete its timeout when disabled.
    - fl_draw() would crash if no font was set (now defaults to
      a 14-pixel Helvetica font)
    - Can't forward declare classes; need to check for "class ", "struct ",
      "union ", etc.  See Bill's message
    - Added #pragma around xlib.h for IRIX
    - FL_KEYBOARD events have the correct x/y when sent to child X
      windows. Note that if you worked around this bug by adjusting the
      x/y yourself you will have to change your code. In addition all
      events have the correct x/y when sent to the grab() widget.  And
      the code to do all this was simplified a lot.
    - The XPM code didn't handle named colors with spaces in the names.
    - Pressing ESCape closed the window with pointer focus, even if there
      was a modal window open (now closes the modal window).
    - FLUID no longer produces trigraphs accidentally in the image data.
    - FLUID uses string constant concatenation to produce shorter image
      data.
    - The Fl_Group deletion code crashed if there was exactly one child
      widget.
    - Simulated overlays in single-buffered Fl_Gl_Windows now draw
      correctly (though very slowly as it requires the entire window to
      be redrawn to erase the overlay).  This fix ported our Digital
      Domain programs better to systems with no overlay hardware.
    - Added support for extern "C" declarations in FLUID.
    - Added Fl_Pack support to FLUID.
    - Fixed the order of #include's in FLUID generated header files.
    - Fixed detection of vsnprintf and snprintf under HP-UX 10.20 once
      and for all.
    - The checkers demo did not compile with GCC 2.95
    - FLUID didn't output virtual destructors properly.
    - Added inline "make_visible()" method to Fl_Browser.
    - Fl::wait() now returns immediately if any timeouts are
      called.
    - 16-bit XPM files are now properly handled.
    - Fl_Window::resize() was missing FL_EXPORT (caused problems
      with Windows DLLs)
    - FLUID was writing extern declarations twice.
    - New FLUID arrow key functionality: arrows move by one pixel, shift+arrow
      resizes, ctrl+arrow steps by grid


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.0.4

    - Documentation updates
    - Fl_Browser::bottomline(size) didn't scroll to the bottom
      if the second-to-last line was visible.
    - fl_wait() didn't poll FDs properly for WIN32.
    - Fixed DLL definitions for BC++.
    - FLUID now handles nested classes properly.
    - The "connect" demo now does a wait() for the PPP process
      so that you aren't left with a lot of zombie processes.
    - Fixed the FLTK colormap to use FF instead of F4 for full
      intensity values.
    - Minor change to scrollbar drawing code to match other
      toolkits.
    - New selections would cancel themselves out in WIN32.
    - The header file links were broken in the IRIX
      distributions.
    - fl_elapsed() now always uses GetClockTick() for WIN32.
    - fl_display is now initialized to GetModuleHandle(NULL) -
      this fixes problems people had with Cygwin and MingW32.
    - WinMain() is no longer compiled in with Cygwin and
      MingW32; it wasn't being used for those compilers anyways.
    - Added Solaris compiler options to configure script.
    - Fl_Value_Input wouldn't update properly if you set the
      value from a callback.
    - Fl_Tile wouldn't resize if the resizeable widget was the
      last child.
    - Was missing #include <ctype.h> and #include <stdlib.h> in
      several files, which caused problems on some platforms.
    - Fixed another case where Fl_Browser_ could get in an
      infinite resizing loop.
    - Fl_win32.cxx now includes <FL/filename.H> to export missing
      DLL symbols.
    - FLUID didn't handle member functions that include the
      scope operator.
    - Fl_Chart was dividing by 0 if there were no data samples
      or if they were all the same (min == max).


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.0.3

    - XDBE is now enabled for IRIX 6.[234] as well as 6.5.
    - FLUID didn't write the when() condition properly.
    - Tab/space/backtab/backspace can be used to navigate
      through menus.
    - Changed $(DSONAME) in the src/Makefile to "libfltk.so.1
      libfltk.sl.1".
    - Fl_Browser could read past the end of the string when
      computing the item height.
    - Fl_Browser could get in an infinite loop when checking to
      see if scrollbars needed to be displayed.
    - FLUID now honors the return type of the outermost widget.
      This was a problem when substituting Fl_Group in an
      Fl_Window widget.
    - Fl_Menu_::copy() wasn't allocating a power of 2 for the
      array size.
    - FLWM would crash if fl_xmousewin was deleted.
    - The fast_slow demo now uses output widgets.
    - Timers under WIN32 were unreliable.


CHANGES IN FLTK 1.0.2

    - Documentation updates
    - The Visual C++ project files didn't include fl_add_idle.cxx.
    - LIBRARY/DSO name inconsistencies in src/Makefile.
    - src/Makefile didn't clean the DSO.
    - The valuator demo now has only a single callback.
    - The code looked for HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H, but the
      config file uses HAVE_SYS_SELECT.
    - Fl_Image redraw not quite right under X11 or WIN32
    - Problems with timeouts & cube demo under WIN32
    - FLUID problems with inline functions.
    - Documentation fixes...
    - Fl_Browser::item_height() didn't handle blank lines or
      non-default fonts properly.
    - FL/math.h didn't have #ifndef...#define...#endif guards
      against multiple inclusion...
    - Fl_Menu_::copy() fix - didn't allocate power of 2...
    - Fl::damage() now remains true until all windows are actually
      redrawn.
    - Fl_Widget destructor, hide(), and deactivate() methods no longer
      send FL_LEAVE, FL_RELEASE, or FL_UNFOCUS events to the widget
      (which could cause applications to crash).
    - FLUID now outputs symbolic names for align() and when().
    - Fixed select() to use maxfd + 1 instead of maxfd.
    - Added "Fl::remove_fd(fd, when)" function so you can remove the
      read and write callbacks separately.
    - The Fl::add_fd() and Fl::add_timeout() arrays are now dynamically
      allocated.
    - FLUID didn't always turn the FL_SUBMENU flag on for submenu titles.
    - The "extra code" in FLUID now is placed before the "o->end()" call
      for Fl_Group and its derived classes.
    - You can now set a FL_Window widget's class in FLUID to Fl_Group to
      generate a function or class that builds part of a GUI (i.e. no window).
    - FLUID now displays "Save file before exiting?" with the standard yes,
      no, and cancel buttons rather than "Discard changes?".
    - Fl_Menu_::add() now works with any type of menu, even one set with
      the menu() method.
    - The keypad keys were not always decoded properly under X11.
    - Some pointers were not being turned off when widgets were deleted,
      which caused some applications (like FLWM) to crash.
