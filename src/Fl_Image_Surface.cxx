/** Constructor with optional high resolution.
 \param w,h Width and height of the resulting image. The value of the \p high_res
 parameter controls whether \p w and \p h are interpreted as pixels or FLTK units.

 \param high_res If zero, the created image surface is sized at \p w x \p h pixels.
 If non-zero, the pixel size of the created image surface depends on
 the value of the display scale factor (see Fl::screen_scale(int)):
 the resulting image has the same number of pixels as an area of the display of size
 \p w x \p h expressed in FLTK units.

 \param off If not null, the image surface is constructed around a pre-existing
 Fl_Offscreen. The caller is responsible for both construction and destruction of this Fl_Offscreen object.
 Is mostly intended for internal use by FLTK.
