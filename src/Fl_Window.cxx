/**
  Waits for the window to be displayed after calling show().

  Fl_Window::show() is not guaranteed to show and draw the window on
  all platforms immediately. Instead this is done in the background;
  particularly on X11 it will take a few messages (client server
  roundtrips) to display the window. Usually this small delay doesn't
  matter, but in some cases you may want to have the window instantiated
  and displayed synchronously.

  Currently (as of FLTK 1.3.4) this method has an effect on X11 and Mac OS.
  On Windows, show() is always synchronous. The effect of show() varies with
  versions of Mac OS X: early versions have the window appear on the screen
  when show() returns, later versions don't.
  If you want to write portable code and need this synchronous show() feature,
  add win->wait_for_expose() on all platforms, and FLTK will just do the
  right thing.

  This method can be used for displaying splash screens before
  calling Fl::run() or for having exact control over which window
  has the focus after calling show().

  If the window is not shown(), this method does nothing.

  \note Depending on the platform and window manager wait_for_expose()
    may not guarantee that the window is fully drawn when it is called.
    Under X11 it may only make sure that the window is \b mapped, i.e.
    the internal (OS dependent) window object was created (and maybe
    shown on the desktop as an empty frame or something like that).
    You may need to call Fl::flush() after wait_for_expose() to make
    sure the window and all its widgets are drawn and thus visible.

  \note FLTK does the best it can do to make sure that all widgets
    get drawn if you call wait_for_expose() and Fl::flush(). However,
    dependent on the window manager it can not be guaranteed that this
    does always happen synchronously. The only guaranteed behavior that
    all widgets are eventually drawn is if the FLTK event loop is run
    continuously, for instance with Fl::run().

  \see virtual void Fl_Window::show()

  Example code for displaying a window before calling Fl::run()

  \code
    Fl_Double_Window win = new Fl_Double_Window(...);

    // do more window initialization here ...

    win->show();                // show window
    win->wait_for_expose();     // wait, until displayed
    Fl::flush();                // make sure everything gets drawn

    // do more initialization work that needs some time here ...

    Fl::run();                  // start FLTK event loop
  \endcode

  Note that the window will not be responsive until the event loop
  is started with Fl::run().

  We recommend to call size_range() if you have a resizable() widget

    If either is zero then FLTK picks a maximum size in that direction
    such that the window will fill the screen.

  \param[in] deltaX,deltaY These are size increments. The window will be
    constrained to widths of <tt>minWidth + N * deltaX</tt>, where N is any
    non-negative integer. If these are less or equal to 1 they are ignored
    (this is always ignored on Windows).

/**
  Protected method to calculate the default size range of a window.

  This method is called internally prior to showing a window to ensure that
  the window's size range values are calculated if a resizable() widget has
  been set but size_range() has not been called explicitly.

  This method does nothing if size_range() has been called before.

  Otherwise FLTK tries to figure out the window's size range from the
  setting of the window's resizable() widget as follows and roughly in
  the given order.

  -# If resizable() is NULL (this is the default) then the window cannot
    be resized and the resize border and max-size control will not be
    displayed for the window.

  -# If either dimension of resizable() is zero, then the window cannot
    resize in that direction.

  -# The resizable() widget is clipped to the window area.

  -# The non-resizable portion of the window is calculated as the difference
    of the window's size and the clipped resizable() widget's size.

  -# If either dimension of the clipped resizable() widget is greater
    than 100, then 100 is considered its minimum width/height. This
    allows the resizable widget to shrink below its original size.

  -# Finally the minimum width/height of the window is set to the
    non-resizable portion plus the width/height of the resizable()
    widget as calculated above.

  In simple words:
    - It is assumed that the resizable() widget can be indefinitely
      enlarged and/or shrunk to a minimum width/height of 100 unless
      it is smaller than that, which is then considered the minimum.
    - The window's size_range() minimum values are set to the sum
      of the non-resizable portion of the window and the previously
      calculated minimum size of the resizable() widget.

  Examples:
  \code
    Fl_Window win(400, 400);
    win.resizable(win);
    // win.size_range(100, 100, 0, 0);
  \endcode

  The minimum size of the resizable is 100, hence the minimum size
  of the total window is also 100 in both directions.

  \code
    Fl_Window win(400, 400);
    Fl_Box box(20, 20, 360, 360);
    win.resizable(box);
    // win.size_range(140, 140, 0, 0);
  \endcode

  The calculated minimum width and height would be 20 + 100 + 20 in both
  dimensions.

  \code
    Fl_Window win(400, 400);

  The width of the resizable is clipped to 200, hence the minimum size of
  the total window is also 200 (fix) + 100 (min. resizable) in x direction.
  The minimum value in y direction is 100 (resizable) + 100 (fixed part).

  The calculation is based on clipping the resizable widget to the window
  area to prevent programming errors and the assumption that the resizable
  widget can be shrunk to 100x100 or its original size, whichever is smaller.

  If this is not what you want, please use Fl_Window::size_range()
  explicitly so you can set any appropriate range.

 Call this and set also the window's desired position before show()'ing the window.
 This can be necessary when a system has several screens with
 distinct scaling factor values because the window's x() and y() may not suffice to
 uniquely identify one screen.
 To see that, consider a system with two screens where the screen at left is A pixel-wide
 and has a scale factor of 1 whereas the screen at right has a scale factor of 2.
 For the sake of simplicity, consider only
 the X coordinates of windows. FLTK coordinates translate directly to pixel coordinates on the
 left screen, whereas FLTK coordinates multiplied by 2 correspond to pixel coordinates
 on the right screen. Consequently, FLTK coordinates between A/2 + 1 and A-1 can map to both
 screens.  Both window coordinates and screen number are necessary to uniquely identify
 where a window is to be mapped.

/** Assigns a non-rectangular shape to the window.
 This function gives an arbitrary shape (not just a rectangular region) to an Fl_Window.
 An Fl_Image of any dimension can be used as mask; it is rescaled to the window's dimension as needed.

 The layout and widgets inside are unaware of the mask shape, and most will act as though the window's
 rectangular bounding box is available
 to them. It is up to you to make sure they adhere to the bounds of their masking shape.

 The \p img argument can be an Fl_Bitmap, Fl_Pixmap, Fl_RGB_Image or Fl_Shared_Image:
 \li With Fl_Bitmap or Fl_Pixmap, the shaped window covers the image part where bitmap bits equal one,
 or where the pixmap is not fully transparent.
 \li With an Fl_RGB_Image with an alpha channel (depths 2 or 4), the shaped window covers the image part
 that is not fully transparent.
 \li With an Fl_RGB_Image of depth 1 (gray-scale) or 3 (RGB), the shaped window covers the non-black image part.
 \li With an Fl_Shared_Image, the shape is determined by rules above applied to the underlying image.
 The shared image should not have been scaled through Fl_Image::scale().

 Platform details:
 \li On the unix/linux platform, the SHAPE extension of the X server is required.
 This function does control the shape of Fl_Gl_Window instances.
 \li On the Windows platform, this function does nothing with class Fl_Gl_Window.
 \li On the Mac platform, OS version 10.4 or above is required.
 An 8-bit shape-mask is used when \p img is an Fl_RGB_Image:
 with depths 2 or 4, the image alpha channel becomes the shape mask such that areas with alpha = 0
 are out of the shaped window;
 with depths 1 or 3, white and black are in and out of the
 shaped window, respectively, and other colors give intermediate masking scores.
 This function does nothing with class Fl_Gl_Window.

 The window borders and caption created by the window system are turned off by default. They
 can be re-enabled by calling Fl_Window::border(1).

 A usage example is found at example/shapedwindow.cxx.
