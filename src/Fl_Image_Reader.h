/*
  This internal (undocumented) class reads data chunks from a file or from
  memory in LSB-first byte order.

  This class is used in Fl_GIF_Image and Fl_BMP_Image to avoid code
  duplication and may be extended to be used in similar cases. Future
  options might be to read data in MSB-first byte order or to add more
  methods.
