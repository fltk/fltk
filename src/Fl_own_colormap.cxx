// Using the default system colormap can be a bad idea on PseudoColor
// visuals, since typically every application uses the default colormap and
// you can run out of colormap entries easily.
//
// The solution is to always create a new colormap on PseudoColor displays
// and copy the first 16 colors from the default colormap so that we won't
// get huge color changes when switching windows.

/** \fn Fl::own_colormap()
 Makes FLTK use its <a href="fltk-colormap.png">own colormap</a>.  This may make FLTK display better
 and will reduce conflicts with other programs that want lots of colors.
 However the colors may flash as you move the cursor between windows.

 <P>This does nothing if the current visual is not colormapped.
