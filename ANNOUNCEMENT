The initial FLTK 1.3.0 is based on the final 1.1.10.

  It adds internationalization, UTF-8 (Unicode), printing support,
  Doxygen based documentation, and several new widgets including
  Fl_Native_File_Chooser, Fl_Table, and Fl_Tree.

FLTK 1.3.4 and previous versions contain many improvements and bug fixes.

  Please see CHANGES for a list of changes in FLTK 1.3.0 to 1.3.4.

  Even though FLTK 1.3.4 does not fix all STRs, we decided to release
  FLTK 1.3.4 as it contains many new features, bug fixes, and adaptations
  to new compiler releases.

  Open bugs and feature requests can be viewed (offline) in KNOWN_BUGS.html
  with your browser. Links in this file direct you to the current state
  (online) of all listed bugs and feature requests.

  Note: This file is a snapshot of http://www.fltk.org/roadmap.php at the
  date of this release (Nov. 11, 2016). Please take into account that some
  bugs and/or feature requests in this list might have been fixed without
  notice.

FLTK 1.3.4 is expected to be the last release in the 1.3.x series.

  All currently open STR's for 1.3.x will be fixed in FLTK 1.4.x, if possible.
